00:00:01 SPK_1
Beauty.

00:00:02 SPK_1
First, thank you for participating in the survey, in this interview.

00:00:08 SPK_1
So, the first thing, how is the question of working with Flutter?

00:00:16 SPK_1
Do you have worked after the project?

00:00:18 SPK_1
Are you already in a new language?

00:00:20 SPK_1
How is this project?

00:00:23 SPK_2
After the project, I stopped, although I wanted to continue studying.

00:00:30 SPK_2
Because it is always good to learn, right?

00:00:33 SPK_2
There is a new tool, right?

00:00:37 SPK_2
But now I'm working with Python, which I got into the internship.

00:00:40 SPK_2
Then I adopt with Python.

00:00:42 SPK_2
I understood.

00:00:45 SPK_1
What was your role in the team?

00:00:50 SPK_2
My role was to take care of the back end, let's say.

00:00:55 SPK_2
The integration of the application database.

00:01:00 SPK_1
Which features were you the most worked on the project?

00:01:03 SPK_2
What are features really?

00:01:06 SPK_1
The features, project resources, the application you worked.

00:01:14 SPK_1
Can you remember?

00:01:17 SPK_2
Let me remember here.

00:01:20 SPK_2
Let me pull here at work.

00:01:23 SPK_2
I worked in, there were several, in the part of creating demand, linking student, opening call, ending call, project list, project details, demand list, various things.

00:01:38 SPK_1
What was the feature that most marked you in the project?

00:01:43 SPK_2
What else marked me?

00:01:47 SPK_2
I don't think I can't say why but let me see it, it's harder.

00:01:56 SPK_2
I think it was there for the end, because when I was finishing, I realized that I had done some wrong things and then I had to go back some things since the things I had done earlier.

00:02:09 SPK_2
I think it may have been in the part of viewing manager.

00:02:18 SPK_1
How would you explain the CDD for a colleague of yours?

00:02:23 SPK_2
I would explain that the CDD is a way of better organizing your code through, say, points that you give to each type of complexity of a language.

00:02:41 SPK_2
For example, IF will have a point, the function will have a point, the strings will have a point, finally, each of these will have a different point.

00:02:54 SPK_2
And there will be a limit, right?

00:02:57 SPK_2
And the goal is to be or equal to the limit or below the limit.

00:03:01 SPK_2
This serves to decrease the complexity of code reading, to make the code less complex to read.

00:03:11 SPK_1
You thought that performing these CDD activities in the project was something quiet, that you got first, or was it a gradual process?

00:03:23 SPK_2
It was a gradual process.

00:03:26 SPK_2
At first it was a little obscure and then it was lightening more.

00:03:29 SPK_1
I understood.

00:03:30 SPK_1
Do you think the CDD was useful?

00:03:35 SPK_2
I think in some, I think in some, some codes were useful because they were really very big and other codes not so much, because although the points did not correspond to what was combined.

00:03:54 SPK_2
Still you could read the code well.

00:03:56 SPK_1
Do you think you had a project step that was more useful or less useful?

00:04:04 SPK_2
A step?

00:04:07 SPK_2
I think in the end.

00:04:09 SPK_1
In the end was it more useful in the case?

00:04:11 SPK_2
Yes.

00:04:11 SPK_1
I understood.

00:04:17 SPK_1
There was any stage that you liked to do the most, which you think is quiet, identified more in doing?

00:04:26 SPK_2
Any stage?

00:04:28 SPK_2
Any stage of applying the CDD?

00:04:30 SPK_1
To apply the CDD, that.

00:04:32 SPK_2
To apply the CDD?

00:04:34 SPK_2
It was in the projects, in the features, the codes of the features I did, after it was very large, it was cool to refact.

00:04:45 SPK_1
So you would say that you became quieter to do these activities during the class reactor process.

00:04:59 SPK_1
Looking at the final table, the final version of the CP table that the team produced, do you agree with all the items that are there?

00:05:07 SPK_1
Or has a particular item that you think it makes no sense?

00:05:11 SPK_1
Or what would you like to add some other item?

00:05:18 SPK_2
Let me see...

00:05:26 SPK_2
I think maybe the camp.

00:05:27 SPK_2
I think it may be a necessary item.

00:05:32 SPK_1
Can you say why?

00:05:35 SPK_2
Because it is not difficult, it is not complex to know what is happening when there is a function camp, in my opinion.

00:05:44 SPK_2
And the riff, in my opinion, is a little gray, because it has parts of riffs that are very easy to understand and sometimes is boring when ...

00:06:03 SPK_2
Especially when they are very chained.

00:06:07 SPK_1
You can come back your speech a little, because you caught up with me audio.

00:06:11 SPK_2
Oh yes.

00:06:13 SPK_2
I think the coupling function, I think may not need to put the ICP, I think in my opinion is not so difficult to read when there is a coupling, and the issue of IF-Elsi, for-nim so much, But more from IF-BSI, also even from the ternary, is very gray, because there are some IFs that are easy to understand, when there is only one if, say an if to show something on a screen, right?

00:06:46 SPK_2
And there are other IFs that are more difficult, in my opinion.

00:06:50 SPK_2
They are mainly when they are chained.

00:06:51 SPK_2
These simpler IFs are boring, you put an ICP point, but these most chained IFs can be understood.

00:07:00 SPK_1
AND...

00:07:02 SPK_1
There is more or less any idea, there is a thought that says you do coupling in a class makes it difficult because you need to browse other classes there, for example, coupled in this class.

00:07:21 SPK_1
For your speech, you said that you do not agree because an coupling does not make it difficult.

00:07:26 SPK_1
So, do you disagree with this speech?

00:07:31 SPK_2
If the name of the function is a very ...

00:07:35 SPK_2
Descriptive of what she does, I think it's easy to understand.

00:07:44 SPK_1
Beauty.

00:07:46 SPK_1
You remember if in the process of building the table there was a lot of disagreement by the team when it comes to developing, choosing the items, of putting a cost for these items or was something more good, did the team come in consensus almost always?

00:08:04 SPK_2
The team, for the most part, has been consensus, sometimes disagreed a little, but is mostly consensus.

00:08:11 SPK_1
Remember something specific, any specific item that the team put that you disagreed?

00:08:22 SPK_2
Let me see...

00:08:28 SPK_2
I think this coupling.

00:08:33 SPK_1
AND...

00:08:36 SPK_2
And only.

00:08:36 SPK_2
The camp and only.

00:08:39 SPK_1
There are some item that you would add that we did not think, did not put in the suggestion table, which you thought later, perhaps, realized?

00:08:49 SPK_2
I think maybe it would be interesting to separate the if and Else from for and while.

00:08:56 SPK_2
I think, in my opinion, especially when I needed to do some database filters, I think it was much harder to understand Wiley's Fall than IF and Else.

00:09:09 SPK_2
I don't think it made sense that they had the same point.

00:09:13 SPK_1
That was going to be a question I was going to ask too, taking the opportunity to do it soon.

00:09:18 SPK_1
So you think the table the way it was, having more specific costs, makes more sense than standardize costs for one, for example, everyone has the same cost?

00:09:34 SPK_2
I think it is better to specify more.

00:09:38 SPK_1
So, in this case, iflse would cost lower than While, for example?

00:09:44 SPK_2
Yeah, than Fore and While.

00:09:47 SPK_1
I understood.

00:09:48 SPK_1
What are the personal criteria you used to decide an item or to determine the cost of any of these table items?

00:10:00 SPK_2
I determined the experience I had to use.

00:10:05 SPK_2
That language tool, for example, Provider, Flutterblock, Futrestream, and Streambuilder, which were things I was not used to moving.

00:10:15 SPK_2
So this interfered in the way I chose the points of the table.

00:10:27 SPK_1
And the cost?

00:10:27 SPK_1
How do you define a cost?

00:10:33 SPK_2
Yeah, if I find one, for example, if I find a steam builder hard to use, I put some more points, right?

00:10:41 SPK_2
For example, or if I don't have so much skill with Flutter Block, I also put more complex points.

00:10:49 SPK_2
I understood.

00:10:50 SPK_1
Do you make comparison between the items you have in the table?

00:10:54 SPK_2
Yes.

00:11:01 SPK_1
Once the initial table has been built and you have started the process of codar the features of the requirements system.

00:11:10 SPK_1
During this process, what was the frequency you used the table?

00:11:14 SPK_1
Did you look at her?

00:11:16 SPK_1
Was it a constant map that you used while you were already coding there?

00:11:20 SPK_1
Or was it another guide that you looked from time to time?

00:11:24 SPK_2
I used the table every time I didn't finish doing a feature.

00:11:27 SPK_2
So, I finished making a screen, I finished doing a feature of the app and soon I would look at the table and try ...

00:11:40 SPK_2
He put the points, right, and if he passed the points tried to repact.

00:11:45 SPK_1
So in your Codar process, didn't you think of CDD?

00:11:50 SPK_1
I just thought at the end, is that it?

00:11:52 SPK_2
This, in the end, just needed in the end.

00:11:54 SPK_1
OK.

00:12:01 SPK_1
Okay, we had three versions of the table.

00:12:04 SPK_1
There was an initial version, a version that changed there in the middle and this latest version that was used in the repatriation.

00:12:11 SPK_1
Do you think these constant meetings they had every week to refine the table was something that helped the most or more disturbed?

00:12:21 SPK_2
I think it helped.

00:12:23 SPK_2
Because the first table we had some points more than CDD and this was then corrected.

00:12:31 SPK_2
So I think it helped.

00:12:35 SPK_1
I understood.

00:12:37 SPK_1
So how was your process to identify, point the ICP and calculate it at the end?

00:12:46 SPK_2
How was the process of whom?

00:12:48 SPK_1
To identify the ICP within your code, point it, say, put something to show where it is and then calculate.

00:12:58 SPK_1
How was this process?

00:13:00 SPK_1
Did you do it at the beginning, during, at the end?

00:13:03 SPK_2
I always did in the end.

00:13:05 SPK_2
I was finished there and then I took the table, analyzed, took the table and analyzed in each category I had placed, each different widget and then I was giving the points and in the end I was adding.

00:13:23 SPK_1
Did you have any class to do this was difficult?

00:13:28 SPK_2
He had.

00:13:29 SPK_1
Remember?

00:13:30 SPK_1
Can you say any examples?

00:13:33 SPK_2
Let me see here at Trello.

00:13:41 SPK_2
I think it was the class of visualizing projects that it was very big.

00:13:47 SPK_2
and the class of viewing demands, which were also quite large.

00:13:51 SPK_2
And then we had to burst from the points and needed to report them.

00:13:57 SPK_1
I understood.

00:13:59 SPK_1
So how often did you exceed this limit in this process of codar?

00:14:05 SPK_1
When you went there and counting, was it frequent that you pass the allowed limit?

00:14:14 SPK_2
No, it was pretty rare to pass the limit.

00:14:17 SPK_2
It was only frequent after we decided in the third version to reduce the maximum points of CP, which was practically all.

00:14:26 SPK_1
Do you think from this changed your style of programming or remained?

00:14:34 SPK_2
I think if I had continued the project would probably have changed yes.

00:14:39 SPK_1
How would it change?

00:14:42 SPK_2
I think I would change what I would try to create more functions and try to reduce code and try to create more classes to reduce code.

00:14:56 SPK_1
I understood.

00:14:59 SPK_1
When you were in this process of balancing the class ICPs, when this class exceeded the limit, and when you would refact, what did you decide that you were more critical to solve?

00:15:15 SPK_2
Can you repeat the question again?

00:15:17 SPK_1
When it was in the process of refactoring the class to put it back to the limit, when it exceeded the allowed limit, how did you decide what was more critical to resolve?

00:15:33 SPK_2
Well, I would take a feature and, for example, had part of this feature that each class solved a problem with her and then I tried I reformed, took this class, then I turned into one and did a follow up on it.

00:15:56 SPK_2
I did that way and diminished the code.

00:15:59 SPK_1
Was it a kind of componentization?

00:16:02 SPK_2
Yeah, I did that, it was a componentization.

00:16:04 SPK_1
I understood.

00:16:07 SPK_1
What were the items?

00:16:09 SPK_1
that you generally tried to extract from the classes.

00:16:12 SPK_1
Did you have a specific item that you aimed or, depending on the context, or did you go to any other strategy?

00:16:21 SPK_2
I went more on the ICP issue.

00:16:24 SPK_2
I tried to mess with ICP and try to mess with class functionality.

00:16:32 SPK_2
For example, if a class she did one thing, I didn't usually cut her in half.

00:16:38 SPK_2
He took her all over and repatted her and put in another part of the file.

00:16:45 SPK_1
So there was no ICPs than you, items in the table that you focused more to try to solve?

00:16:52 SPK_1
Was it, depended on the context?

00:16:54 SPK_2
It was, it depended on the context.

00:16:57 SPK_2
Of course there were times that if I did it, it wouldn't do it.

00:17:01 SPK_2
Then there were some files that I was more by ICP, to try to cut the ICP in half.

00:17:06 SPK_1
I understood.

00:17:11 SPK_1
Do you think the CDD it has had a positive impact on the project?

00:17:18 SPK_2
I think so, because we haven't been able to component more, that some cases in my opinion were a good componentization and other cases not so much.

00:17:34 SPK_2
Because although I sometimes burst the ICP number, sometimes it was not difficult to read.

00:17:42 SPK_2
And then some things I didn't make much sense to split.

00:17:53 SPK_1
Do you think that throughout the process of working with the CDB, there was some time that the complexity of that class did not reflect so much the complexity that was being attributed?

00:18:08 SPK_1
And then there was a change?

00:18:10 SPK_1
He had.

00:18:16 SPK_1
Can you say the moment when, if you had right, the moment when the class she had a complexity when what was attributed to complexity through the CDD did not exactly represent that complexity?

00:18:34 SPK_2
I think there was, I think in my opinion it was in a class called Simon, if I'm not mistaken.

00:18:42 SPK_2
I'm not remembered, but it had, there was.

00:18:46 SPK_2
For example, according to the agreement we had made ICP limit, he had burst, but it was not so difficult to understand.

00:19:00 SPK_2
And it turned out that it was generating another file.

00:19:03 SPK_1
I understood.

00:19:07 SPK_1
Do you think you had any negative impact on using CDD on the project?

00:19:14 SPK_2
Negative, negative not.

00:19:16 SPK_2
I think it had more positive impact.

00:19:20 SPK_1
What would be an indicator that would you show to determine this positive impact?

00:19:29 SPK_2
The indicator would be in the organization of files and facilitating the reading of the files.

00:19:36 SPK_1
Beauty, I understood.

00:19:37 SPK_1
Is there any benefit that you managed to observe while working with the CDB?

00:19:45 SPK_2
Benefit, I think it was the same thing I said, a greater ease of reading.

00:19:57 SPK_1
When would you say that the CDD really made the difference in the project?

00:20:09 SPK_2
I think I would say more for the end, where we managed to apply more, the CDD, since during the project we almost didn't virtually pop it.

00:20:22 SPK_2
So it was more for the end, where the limit fell a lot, we had to cut a lot.

00:20:29 SPK_1
OK.

00:20:30 SPK_1
About the code quality you produced, do you think the CDD helped improve the quality of the code?

00:20:41 SPK_2
Code quality?

00:20:42 SPK_2
I think so.

00:20:49 SPK_2
After I saw that I burst the limit, after I saw that I had very complex files to read, they were component and were easier to read after I applied the CDD.

00:21:04 SPK_1
Did you read your colleagues' code during the process?

00:21:06 SPK_2
Yes.

00:21:09 SPK_1
Do you think the CDD helped in this readability?

00:21:15 SPK_2
I think at first not, because, as I said, we almost did not pop the limit and it was eventually a code, in my opinion, complex to read.

00:21:29 SPK_2
But then, when we did it at the end, they became easier to understand.

00:21:36 SPK_1
Okay, I understood.

00:21:39 SPK_2
But I think one thing that influenced the files was a lot of reading was the organization of folders.

00:21:45 SPK_2
We made it a lot difficult, because sometimes things were very spaced in the archives, we didn't know exactly where it was.

00:21:58 SPK_1
Has the CDD, was it able to indicate a good way when repatorary?

00:22:06 SPK_2
A good way?

00:22:10 SPK_2
Had, had.

00:22:11 SPK_2
I think most of the time yes.

00:22:16 SPK_1
Then it facilitated the process of refactoring overall.

00:22:20 SPK_1
Would you say that the CDD was successful in the project?

00:22:27 SPK_2
I would say that in the end yes.

00:22:29 SPK_2
At first it became a little meaningless, but in the end yes.

00:22:38 SPK_1
So the CDD always made sense or was it confused at some point during the project?

00:22:47 SPK_2
He was confused at the beginning and in the middle.

00:22:50 SPK_1
What did it make it confused?

00:22:51 SPK_1
Was the concept?

00:22:52 SPK_1
Was the application?

00:22:54 SPK_2
It was more the application, because we could never burst the limit and did not reflect when we would refact.

00:23:02 SPK_1
Do you think the CDD made the project more complicated?

00:23:09 SPK_2
I don't think so.

00:23:14 SPK_1
Did you have any difficulty using, dealing with the CDD at any stage of the project at some point?

00:23:23 SPK_2
The difficulty was sometimes to identify and give points with things.

00:23:30 SPK_2
Knowing exactly where we were going to put in ID, we were going like this, etc.

00:23:34 SPK_1
Did you have a problem to understand any item in the table?

00:23:39 SPK_2
I had.

00:23:41 SPK_2
It was the coupling.

00:23:44 SPK_2
The document and edit like this.

00:23:51 SPK_1
Is there anything that you thought this could be easier during the process?

00:24:02 SPK_2
CDB application?

00:24:03 SPK_2
I don't think so.

00:24:04 SPK_1
I think it goes quiet always.

00:24:13 SPK_1
Did you have an inappropriate time from the CDB?

00:24:15 SPK_2
Inappropriate?

00:24:22 SPK_2
I don't think so.

00:24:26 SPK_2
OK.

00:24:34 SPK_1
Okay, do you think the team she accepted the CDD well?

00:24:39 SPK_1
Did she work well with the CDD?

00:24:42 SPK_1
Did you have any resistance or personal or team member in your view?

00:24:50 SPK_1
Either you think the team has always accepted or has always been good?

00:24:53 SPK_2
I think the team has always accepted.

00:24:54 SPK_1
OK.

00:24:59 SPK_1
Would you use CDD in the future?

00:25:04 SPK_2
I think before using a CDD I would try to see a better way to organize the files, but I would use CDD if the team I was working to use.

00:25:18 SPK_1
Do you think it's another CDD teamwork?

00:25:22 SPK_2
AND.

00:25:23 SPK_1
Why?

00:25:29 SPK_2
Other people will read your code, you will read other people's code, right?

00:25:33 SPK_2
I don't think it will be very sense for you to apply it individually.

00:25:38 SPK_1
If someone asked a tip, if anyone wanted to use CDD and asked a tip for you, what would you say?

00:25:48 SPK_2
A tip?

00:25:57 SPK_2
I think it was always trying to refact things that make sense as much as possible and check, study well, decide the CDD limit well.

00:26:17 SPK_1
You said you would apply, but would change some things.

00:26:21 SPK_1
What improvements would you make in the CDD approach to the next project?

00:26:26 SPK_1
What adjustment, specific change would you implement to apply CDD in the future?

00:26:37 SPK_2
I think I would only discuss this issue of if, Elsi and For.

00:26:43 SPK_2
Other than that, I think that's all.

00:26:48 SPK_1
Beauty.

00:26:49 SPK_1
There is something, some thoughts you had about the CDD, some indication, some way that you find important to talk about here, that I didn't ask about, but what did you think?

00:27:02 SPK_2
No.
