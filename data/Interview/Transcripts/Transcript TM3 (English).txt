00:00:03 SPK_1
Well, first, first of all, I want to thank you for participating in this research.

00:00:12 SPK_1
My idea here, initially, is that this research, first, will be part of my TCC, which I will deliver, I intend to deliver this year now, but it is a research that we want to develop this methodology of the CDD within the Environment Flutter, and for that we are first in this project that happened in the course and everything, in the practical project, we wanted to raise ideas, understand how it would work.

00:00:41 SPK_1
And then we want to get all these insights and make a tool, build a tool to automate processes, if necessary, and try to replicate and see what we can do and try to build some path of the CDD within the Flutter environment.

00:00:59 SPK_1
So, the first thing I have to ask is, how was the course for you?

00:01:05 SPK_1
In general, did you have to acquire the knowledge necessary to work with Flutter?

00:01:10 SPK_1
Today are you working with Flutter?

00:01:12 SPK_1
Did you do something beyond what was proposed within that of the course?

00:01:17 SPK_1
How is your situation?

00:01:20 SPK_2
Well, at first I had tried to learn Flutter before, but I was I engaged in the Flutter syntax itself, not Dart.

00:01:31 SPK_2
Dart I always found it interesting, but the Flutter I found a little weird.

00:01:36 SPK_2
Then, with the practice of the course and especially that project, I was able to get their operation better.

00:01:45 SPK_2
Regarding projects I did after the course, I'm doing the TCC now with Flutter.

00:01:58 SPK_1
Are you looking for some internship, any work with Flutter or have you started studying something else?

00:02:09 SPK_2
No, internship is no longer because I am already at the end of the course already, but I was trying to get a little more experience to go after a place because it usually requires a little more so if it is not an internship.

00:02:24 SPK_1
I understood.

00:02:28 SPK_2
As I am also participating in another selection process, I also had to go back to studying react.

00:02:34 SPK_2
I was studying only Flutter because of the TCC, but I went back to studying React as well.

00:02:40 SPK_1
Did Flutter help you in React, for example?

00:02:43 SPK_1
Are there some things that are similar or not?

00:02:46 SPK_2
Yes.

00:02:48 SPK_2
There was a concept that I learned because of a problem I had there during the project, which was ...

00:02:56 SPK_2
Raise the state from a component to a father component to control what happens in the child from the father.

00:03:03 SPK_1
I understood.

00:03:05 SPK_2
Like, I had seen that this was possible conceptually when I was seeing the react before, but I hadn't done it, right?

00:03:13 SPK_2
Then when I needed it now, then I really understood how it works.

00:03:16 SPK_1
Legal.

00:03:18 SPK_1
Beauty, now talking more about the project, what was your role there?

00:03:24 SPK_1
Starting from the beginning that I don't know anything you did there, so what was your role there?

00:03:33 SPK_2
It was the functional part like that, say, and connect with the back end.

00:03:39 SPK_1
So you were a developer, programmer, developed code, was that it?

00:03:45 SPK_2
That, that.

00:03:48 SPK_2
I didn't do as much as others do, but I did some things.

00:03:56 SPK_1
And what were the main activities you did?

00:03:59 SPK_1
What were the system's features that you were most connected with?

00:04:03 SPK_1
Was it front, was a backend?

00:04:05 SPK_1
How was it?

00:04:12 SPK_2
It depends on what you mean by front and back, because the back was already the firebase, because it had to make just connect the application with the firebase.

00:04:24 SPK_2
But so, I was not actively involved.

00:04:28 SPK_1
Node...

00:04:31 SPK_2
Development of the interface, I only followed the pattern that people ...

00:04:36 SPK_2
What.

00:04:36 SPK_1
You write an activity as soon as you dedicated yourself to development.

00:04:43 SPK_1
What was Feature, what was the activity?

00:04:45 SPK_2
The feature that I dedicated most was the form to register the project.

00:04:52 SPK_1
Okay, and you already connected with the database, was that it?

00:04:58 SPK_2
That.

00:04:59 SPK_2
Like, it filled in there from a screen with ...

00:05:09 SPK_2
It had previous information.

00:05:10 SPK_2
I think it was the name of the project and the description, if I'm not mistaken.

00:05:14 SPK_2
And when I entered the screen it was already filled.

00:05:16 SPK_2
Then I had to fill the other information and enter the project.

00:05:24 SPK_1
Beauty.

00:05:26 SPK_1
Now talking more like this, in general of the CDD, how would you explain to someone, to a colleague of yours, what is CDD?

00:05:35 SPK_1
What was your understanding?

00:05:36 SPK_1
What is CDD for you?

00:05:40 SPK_2
It would be a unified language to refer to how the person understands the code, to define whether the code is readable or not.

00:05:57 SPK_2
For example, without the language of the CDD would be more ...

00:06:02 SPK_2
We would turn to some more particular languages ​​of each person, each would talk in a way.

00:06:11 SPK_2
Then with the CDD we have a common vocabulary that we can refer to some part of the code.

00:06:16 SPK_2
Ah, this part here is not good.

00:06:20 SPK_2
The complexity of this part that is tall, right, or surpassed the CP points.

00:06:25 SPK_2
I think his strength is that, it helps to identify and helps to communicate that a part is difficult not to read.

00:06:38 SPK_1
I understood.

00:06:40 SPK_1
So you think the CDD activities were quiet to get first, to understand, or it was another gradual process, which over time you really went to understand what it was to do.

00:06:52 SPK_1
Or not, at first it is very easy to understand and start.

00:06:59 SPK_2
I thought you, like, conceptually, oh, I read, I understand.

00:07:02 SPK_2
Just look for what is listed there and do.

00:07:05 SPK_2
But when it went to do it in practice it was not quite.

00:07:08 SPK_2
Then it took a little longer for me to know what it means here exactly.

00:07:13 SPK_2
I remember, let me see here.

00:07:18 SPK_2
Here in coupling, project class dependence.

00:07:23 SPK_2
I wondered if it was any class, because the video had a class, right?

00:07:29 SPK_2
Technically.

00:07:31 SPK_2
Then it was not very clear here for me.

00:07:35 SPK_1
Ah, so the items there, the ICPs that you took time to understand what these items were like, what the team had defined and such, was that?

00:07:48 SPK_2
That.

00:07:49 SPK_1
I understood.

00:07:50 SPK_1
So, so you say it was a more gradual process, is that it?

00:07:56 SPK_1
Or was it quieter?

00:07:57 SPK_1
I couldn't get it very well.

00:08:00 SPK_2
No, really gradual.

00:08:01 SPK_1
It was a gradual process, ok.

00:08:03 SPK_1
And then, we're still speaking generally, right, from CBD.

00:08:07 SPK_1
Do you think it was more useful or did it hinder the construction of this project, productivity?

00:08:15 SPK_1
In general, so do you think it was more useful or more disturbed?

00:08:25 SPK_2
It didn't get in the way because it was something we did after we delivered the functionality, right?

00:08:29 SPK_2
We marked there as ...

00:08:32 SPK_2
It was not something we did while we developed, we ended the feature after doing it.

00:08:37 SPK_1
AND...

00:08:37 SPK_2
Calm down, we didn't understand what you wanted to say.

00:08:43 SPK_2
Like, you ...

00:08:44 SPK_2
Oh, and how we don't ...

00:08:47 SPK_2
Woke up a folder pattern, I think, folder, file, right away.

00:08:52 SPK_2
I think that's what hindered, not CD Dancer.

00:08:57 SPK_2
Then it made it difficult for the time to refracture, but I don't think it hindered, no.

00:09:01 SPK_2
He helped maintain a language that we can communicate.

00:09:07 SPK_1
I understood.

00:09:07 SPK_1
So, in general, you think it was more useful for understanding the code.

00:09:11 SPK_1
Do you have any specific step?

00:09:14 SPK_1
Thinking of all steps, from the beginning of building the table, to list the items there, give the cost of codar, had to do the manual process, which does not have the plugin, then counting.

00:09:29 SPK_1
From all this process, then until the time to review everything, or at the time of refactoring, in all these steps there, from beginning to end.

00:09:37 SPK_1
There was some stage that you found more interesting to do, there was a stage that you found more difficult, a step that you liked, which you found it easy, that you found interesting, and a stage that you found harder, that you broke a little The head there.

00:09:54 SPK_1
Do you have these examples?

00:09:59 SPK_2
Talk about the development itself, not the CDD.

00:10:01 SPK_1
The whole process, until the construction of the table, in the code, in the refactor, everything.

00:10:10 SPK_2
A part that I liked, I was a little surprised, that I found the testing part of testing, so let's choose the app and find possible bugs or something that is not in accordance with the specifications.

00:10:26 SPK_1
Do you think the CDD improves the process of finding bugs, for example?

00:10:31 SPK_2
I do not think it influences, because we did a manual test, using the direct app, we did not analyze the code by itself.

00:10:42 SPK_1
No, so, use the CDD.

00:10:44 SPK_2
Although we would have to look at the code later, right, to see where the bug could be.

00:10:49 SPK_2
But it is because, so, right away, we just marked the codes with the CDB, but it didn't move at all, it's just marked there.

00:11:02 SPK_1
AND.

00:11:04 SPK_2
Okay, we did not make any modification from that.

00:11:09 SPK_2
At least in the first part of the project, only after it had the part of the refactor.

00:11:14 SPK_2
I don't think it was neutral, nor helped nor disturbed.

00:11:19 SPK_1
What part do you think you got in the way, for example?

00:11:24 SPK_1
That was less useful, which was more boring to do, more challenging?

00:11:32 SPK_2
I think I found it more boring ...

00:11:36 SPK_2
Not that I found it more boring, but the development itself was the one that hindered me the most, because I had difficulty understanding some concepts right away.

00:11:44 SPK_1
But do you attribute this because are you starting on the Flutter or because the CDD made it difficult?

00:11:52 SPK_2
No, no, no.

00:11:53 SPK_2
It was the lack of experience.

00:11:55 SPK_1
Okay.

00:11:56 SPK_1
But on the CDD, do you think that in this process specifically of the CDD there was a harder step?

00:12:10 SPK_2
Make the count.

00:12:10 SPK_1
Make the count, manual there, right?

00:12:15 SPK_2
As I said, some of the specifications I was in doubt what you meant.

00:12:22 SPK_1
Do you think that after all you managed to understand all the items in the table?

00:12:30 SPK_2
No, that class side, class dependence, I have a little doubt what it means.

00:12:36 SPK_1
Okay, I understood.

00:12:37 SPK_1
So, not all items have you understood 100%?

00:12:39 SPK_1
Yes.

00:12:41 SPK_1
Beauty.

00:12:43 SPK_1
Okay, and then, talking, right now, talking about the table specifically, you agree with 100% that is there, right, you already said that there is an item there that, for example, you do not understand very well, but you Agree with the final version of the table, agrees with everything there, or you think it was missing the item, now talking about the individual, right, because the table was a collective construction and such the team.

00:13:06 SPK_1
the team's understanding.

00:13:07 SPK_1
Now, if you are looking personal, individual, do you agree with what is in the table, 100% of it, or do you have something you would change there?

00:13:16 SPK_1
Let's see ...

00:13:35 SPK_2
Now I think I wouldn't take or add anything, I can't think about how it could improve.

00:13:44 SPK_2
Except maybe I better define this part that I was confused, but taking it out.

00:13:52 SPK_1
I understood.

00:13:53 SPK_1
There was an item, for example, of the first version for the last one that left, which was those basic widgets, which were Rows or Columns.

00:14:02 SPK_1
When it appeared in the code, we marked there as an ICP.

00:14:06 SPK_1
Would you take this item forward or not?

00:14:10 SPK_1
Or would you really take it?

00:14:13 SPK_2
No, I would take it because at first we were still being used to widgets, but after we were used to it, it didn't make much sense to be in the end.

00:14:21 SPK_1
So in the beginning he made sense and then he lost meaning, is that it?

00:14:27 SPK_2
That.

00:14:29 SPK_1
Okay, I understood.

00:14:31 SPK_1
Now yes, come on.

00:14:33 SPK_1
Still talking about the table and the construction of the table, for example, I will use this example with everyone, which is, when I will choose a shirt to buy me, I will define there a color that I like, I will define a size I find it more interesting, if I want tighter, if I want more loose, I define a style, if it's a social shirt, polo shirt, anyway.

00:14:51 SPK_1
These are criteria that I use to choose a shirt.

00:14:54 SPK_1
What were the criteria you used to choose an ICP item in the table?

00:15:06 SPK_2
I chose the ones I thought would have difficulty understanding.

00:15:16 SPK_1
Did you have any other criterion you used?

00:15:21 SPK_1
For example, you spoke difficult, right?

00:15:23 SPK_1
It would be there what you least know, a concept that you least know, you determined there that it was the item that could be there.

00:15:31 SPK_1
Was it?

00:15:34 SPK_1
Do you have another item or do you use this exclusively?

00:15:47 SPK_2
I think anything that could crowd a lot of code, nest a lot of code in one place that had potential for it, I would put it too.

00:16:00 SPK_2
Even if I understand the concept, if it brings this possibility of putting a lot together.

00:16:06 SPK_1
Can you give an example of such a case?

00:16:10 SPK_1
Can you remember any example?

00:16:13 SPK_2
The first item here of ...

00:16:15 SPK_2
It's the second, Branches and Loops.

00:16:17 SPK_2
It has this potential here, Fielcity.

00:16:19 SPK_2
If we are putting a lot inside the other, or if the condition is too large, it can cause a difficulty of understanding right away.

00:16:28 SPK_2
I don't know, a condition that gives two, three lines.

00:16:33 SPK_2
You have to read two more, three, four times to understand what is happening.

00:16:37 SPK_1
Okay, so it would be like an item that you see that has a potential to create many lines, a lot of alignment, you already thought of it as ICP.

00:16:47 SPK_1
Yes.

00:16:48 SPK_1
Do you remember any situation where people most divided, why was it a collective issue of the team?

00:16:56 SPK_1
Was there any item that someone got up or that came from that table that suggested ICPS, which people were more in doubt, if they divided more?

00:17:05 SPK_1
Or an item the team was in favor and that you didn't agree much, or did you think the cost of this item was not what it was?

00:17:18 SPK_1
Remember any situation?

00:17:24 SPK_2
Let me think a little here.

00:17:46 SPK_2
I could say that ...

00:17:50 SPK_2
They have changed any costs, for example, if they have become familiar with some concept, we will decrease the cost of CP.

00:18:05 SPK_2
But looking here the table this did not happen except, I think in the coupling, it fell from 2 to 1.

00:18:14 SPK_1
Did you agree with this cost reduction?

00:18:24 SPK_1
Or not, not for you, it's still difficult, it's still complicated.

00:18:27 SPK_2
Because like this, what is difficult for me to understand is not me to look in the code the item and see that its complexity is high.

00:18:41 SPK_2
I had difficulty understanding what it means, got it?

00:18:44 SPK_2
When I found him, I couldn't find it because I was wondering what exactly he defined.

00:18:50 SPK_1
Right.

00:18:51 SPK_2
Not that his complexity in the code was to generate some difficulty of understanding.

00:19:01 SPK_2
My difficulty was understanding what he meant.

00:19:03 SPK_1
I understood.

00:19:04 SPK_1
When you were there and such, how it was ...

00:19:09 SPK_1
How was your frequency to look at the table, to consult the ICPS table?

00:19:14 SPK_1
It was another map that you constantly looked while developing or was one thing ...

00:19:20 SPK_1
It was a ...

00:19:22 SPK_1
Did this table look only once in a while?

00:19:26 SPK_2
I never looked.

00:19:27 SPK_2
I looked only after I finished everything, it was ready, then I was going to point the ICPs.

00:19:33 SPK_1
You identified, put the comment there and made the accounting.

00:19:39 SPK_1
Or not?

00:19:39 SPK_1
While you developed, you were already commenting the ICP, pointing it before, without going out the count, right?

00:19:46 SPK_1
I believe the count was for the end.

00:19:48 SPK_1
Or not?

00:19:49 SPK_1
How was it?

00:19:52 SPK_2
Like, only after I finished everything already, that everything is working, then that I was going to point out to be able to do Commit.

00:20:00 SPK_1
Tell us, this question I'm asking here, telling you would just go see where you marked the ICP or you marked the ICP and told you soon?

00:20:12 SPK_2
Oh ok, I got it.

00:20:13 SPK_2
So I marked the comment and was already putting it in, in the sum already.

00:20:22 SPK_2
Then after I did this sum, I came back and told all over again to see if I had not forgotten anything.

00:20:27 SPK_1
Okay, and this always at the end of the code?

00:20:30 SPK_1
I mean, always at the end of the activity?

00:20:33 SPK_1
Like, you coded, tested, told working there that you were going to do this process, is that it?

00:20:39 SPK_2
Exactly.

00:20:41 SPK_1
Okay, beauty.

00:20:45 SPK_1
Looking at the initial table and the final table, you see that they had more specific costs there.

00:20:52 SPK_1
For example, asynchronous programming, you have cost for when you create or when you manipulate some asynchronous and such function.

00:21:04 SPK_1
You were in favor of this or do you think you had to unify, for example, for a whole world, is almost the same?

00:21:15 SPK_1
Or do you agree how?

00:21:19 SPK_2
No, I agree.

00:21:20 SPK_2
Manipulate I think more ...

00:21:22 SPK_2
It is more confusing than creating.

00:21:25 SPK_2
Because when you create, you need a definition of her, right?

00:21:29 SPK_2
Now when you are going to manipulate, you have to think about how exactly it is working there.

00:21:34 SPK_2
So I agree that the complexity of manipulating has to be greater than creating.

00:21:38 SPK_1
I got it, ok.

00:21:40 SPK_1
And then, this question of constantly analyzing the table, because we, every sprint end, we made a review about the table, if the items made sense.

00:21:52 SPK_1
Do you think this was more beneficial helping to enhance the table or do you think it hindered overall?

00:22:01 SPK_2
No, no, no.

00:22:02 SPK_2
It was beneficial because our understanding of what was or not complicated was changing throughout the project.

00:22:11 SPK_2
So it was beneficial because we were improving the table and it is getting more in accordance with our understanding.

00:22:20 SPK_1
I understood.

00:22:21 SPK_1
There was some class, right?

00:22:23 SPK_1
You already told us the process of how you did it, right?

00:22:26 SPK_1
You first developed everything, put the ICP there, then counting.

00:22:30 SPK_1
Do you remember any class that was very difficult to make this count?

00:22:34 SPK_1
To do this part of the process?

00:22:37 SPK_1
Some time, any class?

00:22:48 SPK_2
What I really did ...

00:22:56 SPK_2
The project form there, I basically every boost there in the form had a function.

00:23:07 SPK_2
And I wondered if I should put the function there for my argument, tell the function for my argument or not.

00:23:16 SPK_2
And also as I separated in a custom rate downwards, and I did a lot of custom text-films, then I wondered if I should add this as class dependence, because widget is a class, right?

00:23:34 SPK_2
Do I add or not?

00:23:36 SPK_2
I was in doubt in these two points.

00:23:37 SPK_1
I understood.

00:23:39 SPK_1
It is still the same item, right, that you were talking before, that you did not learn very well.

00:23:44 SPK_1
Okay, so that was more challenging.

00:23:45 SPK_1
So ok.

00:23:50 SPK_1
Was there a moment that you left the CBD aside?

00:23:53 SPK_1
Like, I was developing, I didn't even think about CDD, I didn't think about anything, just thought about Feature.

00:23:59 SPK_2
At some point I just thought ...

00:24:02 SPK_2
In 100% of the project, as I said, I just looked at the CDD after I already did everything, I was working.

00:24:08 SPK_1
So that was constant, right?

00:24:11 SPK_1
Yes.

00:24:12 SPK_1
So, how often did you exceed this limit that we had determined there?

00:24:20 SPK_1
Since you were developing, then I arrived in the end, you were going to count.

00:24:26 SPK_1
Was it frequent that you tell and see that you exceeded the limit?

00:24:35 SPK_2
The first one I did, no.

00:24:37 SPK_2
I didn't pass, because it was a very high limit, since it was double the possible items.

00:24:46 SPK_2
But in that latest version, he has halfway the limit, then a class that had passed before, did not pass.

00:24:58 SPK_2
So, I think as I just did this file, so it was only 50-50, right?

00:25:08 SPK_2
Okay, I understood.

00:25:09 SPK_1
So when you reduced in half, the most, then it really passed, you had to refact the class.

00:25:18 SPK_2
Yeah, if I consider that I only did this file, I think it was 50% of the time.

00:25:21 SPK_1
Okay, I understood.

00:25:24 SPK_1
Right then you had to do the refactor, what did you look and decide that it was more critical of resolving to try to reduce this complexity and make the class acceptable?

00:25:37 SPK_1
What items did you find most critical of solving?

00:25:45 SPK_2
I took the widgets that I saw that I could extract for something separate to decrease the size of the tree, right?

00:25:57 SPK_2
The way I was, the class I got to do, was like one inside the other just a gigantic widget tree.

00:26:06 SPK_1
What item do you look?

00:26:09 SPK_1
You can complete, sorry.

00:26:12 SPK_2
Then I saw what you could take from there, to put in the separate eye.

00:26:18 SPK_1
And there was an item as soon as you looked?

00:26:20 SPK_1
What item you extracted, right?

00:26:27 SPK_1
What is the table items you ...

00:26:29 SPK_1
Usually you looked and said, I think I'll take this one here, which is easier to deal with, maybe.

00:26:38 SPK_1
Did you have that thought or not?

00:26:48 SPK_2
I looked ...

00:26:53 SPK_2
It was a conditional generation, this girl had about three possibilities of generation.

00:27:03 SPK_2
Then what I ended up looking was the condition I saw how many output possibilities I had.

00:27:14 SPK_2
Then I extracted the exits in this case.

00:27:16 SPK_2
So I looked at the if, in this case.

00:27:19 SPK_2
I think it was IF of the condition of rendering.

00:27:23 SPK_2
Then I extracted the exits, because there was just a small edit there in return.

00:27:29 SPK_2
Three small edits, in this case.

00:27:30 SPK_1
I understood.

00:27:31 SPK_2
So, you looked ...

00:27:32 SPK_2
And there was a big edit.

00:27:34 SPK_1
You first saw all the possibilities and saw what was most interesting to you.

00:27:38 SPK_1
You didn't have an item as soon as you looked and said like this, no, I'm going to the hardest item or I go to the easier item.

00:27:45 SPK_1
Did you have this criterion like this when choosing?

00:27:50 SPK_1
Or, oh, this item I know more.

00:27:52 SPK_1
No.

00:27:53 SPK_1
It was based on the context that was there.

00:27:56 SPK_2
Yeah, technically you can say that I know more, right?

00:28:04 SPK_2
That's what I understand.

00:28:06 SPK_2
The others, for example ...

00:28:10 SPK_2
I don't know, Flutterform and Block.

00:28:13 SPK_2
I couldn't move because I didn't get to learn it right, so I didn't have much to do.

00:28:19 SPK_2
Provider I didn't even move.

00:28:23 SPK_2
Yeah, so really what I moved was what I already had familiarity, what I knew how to do.

00:28:31 SPK_2
That was the criterion, it was not the hardest.

00:28:34 SPK_1
Okay, and then I try to understand what were the benefits we had using the CDD.

00:28:42 SPK_1
And then the question that I ask you like this is, like, looking at the impact, what impacted on the project, you think the CDD had the most positive impact, looking at the whole project, for deliveries, what we produced, Did he have a positive or negative impact?

00:29:04 SPK_1
And if it was positive, what were these positive impacts that you felt?

00:29:16 SPK_2
Because, technically, we only took them into consideration at the end, right?

00:29:22 SPK_2
After we were over.

00:29:23 SPK_2
I don't remember if we ...

00:29:26 SPK_2
We were more focused on telling, defining what should be told, and only when we ended, that we went to take into consideration what already had there to be able to improve.

00:29:41 SPK_2
So, most of the project, I would say he was indifferent because we didn't take it to reflect right away.

00:29:51 SPK_2
But considering the period of refactoring, it was crucial to helping us to identify what needed to be modified.

00:30:05 SPK_2
So it was positive.

00:30:07 SPK_2
If I didn't have that, it would be very subjective what would have to change.

00:30:13 SPK_2
But, as I said too, he alone I found a little ...

00:30:19 SPK_2
I didn't find it enough.

00:30:21 SPK_2
He is useful, but he alone does not realize the message.

00:30:26 SPK_1
Did you know, before the CDD, had you ever heard of CDD?

00:30:34 SPK_2
CDD No, I had heard of that TDD, DDD, but just hearing, I never worked with anything.

00:30:40 SPK_1
Did you know?

00:30:41 SPK_2
I only know by name.

00:30:44 SPK_1
Any of these code design techniques, had you ever studied something like that?

00:30:51 SPK_2
I read a little of Clean Code, but I didn't even apply it, I just gave a fiery and such.

00:30:59 SPK_2
CDB even I had never heard, it was the first time I went.

00:31:02 SPK_1
Okay, coming back on impact.

00:31:05 SPK_1
Negative impact can you think of any?

00:31:11 SPK_1
Used CDB impacted negatively on anything?

00:31:15 SPK_2
No, I don't think so.

00:31:21 SPK_2
Because, as I said, during the development phase it is neutral, right?

00:31:26 SPK_2
And when it was time to refact it he helped, so ...

00:31:30 SPK_2
I don't see how this would be negative.

00:31:31 SPK_1
Can you say why in the development phase he is neutral?

00:31:38 SPK_2
Because, at least for me, I didn't take him into consideration while I made the code.

00:31:42 SPK_2
Only after I already did I counting, just to have the code counted, right?

00:31:49 SPK_1
So he didn't change your development style, because you didn't even think about it, is that it?

00:31:56 SPK_2
That.

00:31:56 SPK_1
I understood.

00:31:58 SPK_2
I thought after I already did it, then I saw that I needed modification, then I took care of consideration.

00:32:04 SPK_1
Do you think he had more impact, still talking about impact, at the end of the project than at the beginning?

00:32:13 SPK_2
That.

00:32:15 SPK_1
Okay, I understood.

00:32:18 SPK_1
You can think of a direct benefit, right?

00:32:21 SPK_1
First we spoke of impact, now a benefit, what you, when he was useful to you, when you used the CDB and was thinking about him, which suggested benefit in your code, in your style, quality, quality, In readability?

00:32:39 SPK_1
Did you feel any benefit when using this method, this approach?

00:32:57 SPK_2
Yeah, I didn't see so much difference, because as I said, I didn't take into consideration, but ...

00:33:06 SPK_2
Maybe later, when I was already used to, I could change the flow, right?

00:33:13 SPK_2
Instead of doing this in the end, already have the items in mind and put it in the direct code.

00:33:20 SPK_2
But the way I did it during the project, no.

00:33:24 SPK_2
I don't think it impacted, it had no direct influence on the way I Codo.

00:33:30 SPK_1
At the time of refactoring, did he bring any benefit?

00:33:36 SPK_2
Yes.

00:33:37 SPK_2
It helped identify the problem classes in the house.

00:33:43 SPK_1
I understood.

00:33:46 SPK_1
Do you think using CDD makes the code more readable?

00:33:51 SPK_1
That is, you look at the code and can understand what is written there.

00:33:55 SPK_1
Do you think the CDD impacts it?

00:34:10 SPK_2
Once the code is modified because of it, not before that.

00:34:15 SPK_1
Do you think that after refactoring, using the CDD, will it be more readable?

00:34:21 SPK_2
That.

00:34:24 SPK_1
So, I think the quality too.

00:34:27 SPK_1
Did you feel any improvement in code quality?

00:34:32 SPK_1
Or if we hadn't using the CDD, would the quality be the same?

00:34:40 SPK_2
It wouldn't be the same because we weren't going to do it anyway, there would be no method.

00:34:46 SPK_2
So he actually helps to improve quality.

00:34:49 SPK_2
It is a metric that we can use to identify what needs to be changed.

00:34:57 SPK_2
So, yes, it impacts the quality.

00:35:00 SPK_2
For the better, in this case.

00:35:02 SPK_1
How would you measure success?

00:35:04 SPK_1
Do you think the CDD was successful in the project?

00:35:06 SPK_1
He did what did you expect him to do?

00:35:18 SPK_2
When you talk like that, I think more at the beginning.

00:35:23 SPK_1
Right?

00:35:25 SPK_2
From the beginning of development until before the repatriation.

00:35:30 SPK_2
So, in this ...

00:35:36 SPK_2
What was the question?

00:35:37 SPK_2
I forgot.

00:35:38 SPK_1
No, I asked if you consider that the CDD was successful in the application, in the project.

00:35:51 SPK_2
Ah, successful?

00:35:53 SPK_2
Yeah, I really didn't think right.

00:36:15 SPK_2
I think you had some difficulties applying it 100%.

00:36:23 SPK_2
I think the understanding of each one differentiated a little.

00:36:26 SPK_2
And when we went to tell, it was not exactly that we woke up, because each one understood in a way.

00:36:32 SPK_2
I realized this when you recount there in the tables.

00:36:35 SPK_1
Do you think the CDD was confused to the team, for you, in your perception?

00:36:43 SPK_1
Was he just made sense after or was always confusing?

00:36:46 SPK_1
How is the understanding you had, what the whole team had about its use?

00:36:55 SPK_1
Would you say this is a challenge of what the CDB had for you, the project?

00:37:02 SPK_2
Ah, because when we were coordinating the table, we had a more theoretical view than what could increase complexity, but when it comes to counting, we kind of differentiated what exactly told and what not what , even we had previously woken up what they told.

00:37:26 SPK_2
Like, as if it had a difference of what is on paper and when applying what is there in the code.

00:37:33 SPK_2
I think there was a little ...

00:37:35 SPK_2
What would be the word?

00:37:36 SPK_1
Is that the challenge?

00:37:39 SPK_1
AND.

00:37:42 SPK_2
Dissonance, I think.

00:37:47 SPK_2
A disconnection of what we theoretically understand when applying.

00:37:54 SPK_1
OK.

00:37:55 SPK_1
Would you say what would be the biggest challenge to use CDD seeing the experience you had?

00:38:07 SPK_2
To really understand what you need to be in the count?

00:38:12 SPK_2
To look at the code and know… no, this part of the code here fits that requirement there… on that item in the table, so it needs to be counted.

00:38:23 SPK_2
It needs to be told this amount of times.

00:38:29 SPK_1
Do you think if it were an automated process, would it be much better?

00:38:34 SPK_2
For sure.

00:38:36 SPK_2
Because then there would be this subjectivity, right?

00:38:42 SPK_2
The tool would analyze the face code and already give the score.

00:38:45 SPK_2
We wouldn't need to think about it.

00:38:50 SPK_1
Is there a CDD process that you think should be easier?

00:38:59 SPK_2
Easier?

00:39:04 SPK_2
Like this, manual ...

00:39:05 SPK_2
I don't know how easier it could, get it?

00:39:12 SPK_1
I didn't understand.

00:39:13 SPK_2
It could be easier, but how could you?

00:39:16 SPK_1
No, first thinking ...

00:39:19 SPK_1
In this process, what do you think would be easier?

00:39:21 SPK_1
Not thinking about how, but what would be easier?

00:39:23 SPK_1
I think it would be easier to apply CBD if such a thing happened, or if it was otherwise this part here.

00:39:31 SPK_1
Thinking about the table definition, when applying in the code, when it comes to refactor.

00:39:42 SPK_2
No, I can't think yet.

00:39:48 SPK_1
Okay.

00:39:50 SPK_1
Do you think the team had any resistance with the CDD?

00:39:55 SPK_1
Did you have resistance on the CDD to start?

00:40:04 SPK_2
Yeah, I avoided thinking about it until the time I needed to send the final code.

00:40:15 SPK_2
I wanted to avoid thinking about every detail of that not to stop me at the time of development.

00:40:22 SPK_2
So you can say yes, I had a resistance and left it for the end.

00:40:28 SPK_1
Okay.

00:40:30 SPK_1
You said a little behind that you think the CDD has a positive impact and that it is beneficial.

00:40:39 SPK_1
So when did you think about it?

00:40:43 SPK_1
When did you come to this conclusion?

00:40:50 SPK_2
When I realized the monstrosity that the code was at the end without moving anything, without taking this consideration.

00:40:58 SPK_2
I realized, oh, this here needs to be wet to be easier to read.

00:41:01 SPK_1
So did you just understand that at the end of the project?

00:41:06 SPK_2
No, at the end of ...

00:41:09 SPK_2
from Feature.

00:41:11 SPK_2
I understood.

00:41:15 SPK_2
Like, I didn't take anything into consideration, I just did what was in the head.

00:41:20 SPK_2
So, looking here ...

00:41:21 SPK_2
If you could go back ...

00:41:24 SPK_1
For the beginning of the project, what would you bring in lesson and what would you do differently?

00:41:40 SPK_2
Not necessarily in relation to the CDD, right?

00:41:44 SPK_1
No, on the CDD, about the CDD.

00:41:46 SPK_1
Of the CDD activities, would you invest more time on?

00:42:00 SPK_2
Make clear among members what exactly each item means to have a more effective count when analyzing the code.

00:42:11 SPK_1
Okay, so what would be your tip for a team that is wanting to apply CDD, which has more or less the same profile you had?

00:42:20 SPK_1
What tip you would give to these people when they came to ask you, what tip you have for me to use CDD in a Flutter project?

00:42:33 SPK_2
One thing I thought now was to have examples for confused cases.

00:42:43 SPK_2
Like, there is the item listed, but when I realized that he could have some disagreement of understanding, I had, I don't know, a separate document or a document with examples of each item.

00:43:02 SPK_2
Instead of having only the general definition of the item, there are examples of it.

00:43:10 SPK_1
I understood.

00:43:11 SPK_1
So you would invest more time to understand the items than the CDD itself, do you think it is more important to understand the items, their application, than to understand CDD theory?

00:43:29 SPK_2
Yeah, because it is no use defining if we do not understand when explaining, so it is a crucial step in my view.

00:43:37 SPK_1
Do you think you had this flaw?

00:43:42 SPK_2
I think you can say yes.

00:43:48 SPK_1
What is the improvement that you would bring in a future project?

00:43:53 SPK_1
If you were going to use CDD in a Flutter Futur Future Project, what improvement would you bring in this approach?

00:44:06 SPK_2
That part of the examples, right away we couldn't have.

00:44:10 SPK_2
So, really, we start with something simpler.

00:44:14 SPK_2
And, I don't know, after the first, second week that doubts began to emerge, then that we will feed the table with examples.

00:44:25 SPK_1
You think ...

00:44:27 SPK_1
You can complete.

00:44:29 SPK_2
I would not soon do the examples.

00:44:31 SPK_2
Yeah, I wouldn't put the examples right away.

00:44:34 SPK_2
Unless it was obvious, right?

00:44:36 SPK_2
But...

00:44:39 SPK_2
We looking like this, we realized, oh, I didn't understand, I'll do it.

00:44:42 SPK_2
But if any item started to generate this kind of confusion, then it would be time to add the examples.

00:44:54 SPK_2
Not to complicate the process too much.

00:44:59 SPK_1
I understood.

00:45:01 SPK_2
And increasing it.

00:45:03 SPK_1
Do you think the implementation of the CP table has to be a more gradual process as well?

00:45:10 SPK_1
That is, in the beginning very basic and then put the items that the team understands.

00:45:17 SPK_1
And that?

00:45:17 SPK_1
Is it similar to what I said?

00:45:21 SPK_2
Yeah, because you can't know what the stone will be in the shoe, right?

00:45:27 SPK_2
We only see this throughout the process.

00:45:34 SPK_1
I understood.

00:45:34 SPK_1
Is there anything like that?

00:45:36 SPK_2
So, the improvement, right?

00:45:38 SPK_1
As?

00:45:40 SPK_2
So if you notice there, the improvement would be to add examples of controversial points throughout the table development process.

00:45:52 SPK_1
So would you keep periodic meetings to talk about the CP table?

00:45:59 SPK_2
Yes yes.

00:46:00 SPK_1
I understood.

00:46:02 SPK_1
So there's something you thought, that you thought, that I didn't ask you here, that you think it's important to share?

00:46:09 SPK_1
Some thoughts you had during the process, which you think will help in our research, will help teams in the future, people who are starting, people until, I don't know, they have been working with Flutter for some time ?

00:46:30 SPK_1
Is there anything more to share?

00:46:32 SPK_1
Any learning?

00:46:40 SPK_2
No, I think what I had to say about that I already said.

00:46:47 SPK_1
Would you use CDD on Flutter?

00:46:48 SPK_2
Again?

00:46:48 SPK_1
Or would you look for another technique?

00:46:50 SPK_1
I would use ...

00:47:05 SPK_2
Like, if it were team, right?

00:47:07 SPK_2
Me doing alone I would not do.

00:47:10 SPK_1
No individual, but in team do you think it is worth inverting?

00:47:17 SPK_1
Yes.

00:47:19 SPK_2
Because I alone would have no problem ...

00:47:25 SPK_2
Each I have a different understanding, because it's just me, right?

00:47:28 SPK_2
So, I'll know what it is.

00:47:29 SPK_1
What is not.

00:47:31 SPK_1
You read a lot.

00:47:31 SPK_2
Another person's code?

00:47:37 SPK_2
I read as I was testing and when I had to refact.

00:47:46 SPK_1
Was it easy to understand his code?

00:47:51 SPK_2
No, because he had a lot, a lot like that in one file.

00:47:56 SPK_2
Some parts I had to read several times.

00:48:01 SPK_1
When you read after you reduced the complexity, the maximum of a class to 13, at the time it was 26, then went to 13.

00:48:11 SPK_1
Did you also read the code of your colleagues right now?

00:48:20 SPK_2
I read from a file, which was what I had done before, then someone else refined.

00:48:29 SPK_1
Do you think her rejecting has improved?

00:48:31 SPK_2
The code was much leaner.

00:48:36 SPK_2
It was easier to understand, although I didn't have everything I had put in mine, I didn't have all the features, but the readability improved.

00:48:47 SPK_2
Mine was really harder to understand than the new one.

00:48:51 SPK_1
Didn't you repair another person's code?

00:48:57 SPK_2
I repatted.

00:48:59 SPK_2
I didn't change much, I just tried to leave it at the limit of ICP, the total score.

00:49:11 SPK_2
And also, how do I extract the code?

00:49:19 SPK_1
No, you can complete it.

00:49:25 SPK_1
You can complete what I was talking about.

00:49:27 SPK_2
Calm down, I'm going ...

00:49:31 SPK_2
It's because he gave a locked here, your video is ...

00:49:35 SPK_2
Say something here, just to make sure it's not ...

00:49:38 SPK_2
Here, a.

00:49:39 SPK_1
Your voice is calm, only the video that is giving a lock, but it is no problem.

00:49:49 SPK_2
No, the code was really hard to understand why it lacked some features that depended on each other, we repeated, right?

00:50:04 SPK_2
Like, a ...

00:50:06 SPK_2
Sometimes one depended on the other, but we were doing at the same time.

00:50:09 SPK_2
Sometimes I had a repetition of something that should be here ...

00:50:12 SPK_2
Then I think it complicated a little too.

00:50:18 SPK_2
Had a lot of duplication of code.

00:50:22 SPK_2
And it had a very loaded code, with a lot inside one file.

00:50:27 SPK_2
This was something else that made it difficult.

00:50:31 SPK_1
And then after you refacts, put it inside the limit, do you think it became more readable?

00:50:36 SPK_1
Was it less complex to understand?

00:50:44 SPK_2
Yeah, a little.

00:50:45 SPK_2
It could have done better.

00:50:48 SPK_2
I extracted the edits of the tree, but I didn't take it from the file, I left there at the end of the file.

00:50:54 SPK_2
Because I was wondering where I would put the new file.

00:50:59 SPK_2
But as I didn't know where to put it, I left it right there.

00:51:03 SPK_1
Beauty.

00:51:06 SPK_1
Well, I think that's it.

00:51:08 SPK_1
You brought a lot of insights here about how the experience went and what we can change.

00:51:15 SPK_1
And then, if you think of something else, remember some situation that you think is important, you can send me there on WhatsApp.

00:51:22 SPK_1
You can have you write or send an audio.

00:51:24 SPK_1
If you remember something you think it's pertinent to tell us.

00:51:29 SPK_1
And then there is my thanks, first in the whole project, in the course, and about the CDD itself.

00:51:37 SPK_1
I think your contribution will really help us create best practices and think of a more effective way that we can apply, replicate what happened in the last three months we worked.

00:51:56 SPK_1
And that's it, thank you, thanks for the insights and sharing it.

00:52:06 SPK_2
I wanted to thank you too, I don't think I did it last time.

00:52:10 SPK_2
I really could learn a lot throughout the project, which I had not been able to do before alone.

00:52:17 SPK_2
And it really helped me a lot.

00:52:21 SPK_1
Beauty.

00:52:22 SPK_1
Anything, have questions and things too, besides the CDD, right, have doubts, things to share, both me and Wendel, we are always on Whatsapp and we like to keep the contact and projects that can arise, we You can share with you too.

00:52:40 SPK_1
Lately we're kind of busy, but ...

00:52:43 SPK_1
We intend to follow up with more projects, if they are also interested in sharing, helping to develop these projects as well, to work with monitoring.

00:52:56 SPK_2
Will you graduate this year too?

00:52:58 SPK_1
Yes.

00:52:59 SPK_1
I intend to do masters and continue a little at the gym.

00:53:05 SPK_1
So, I intend to continue such work, as was the course still in the FPA.

00:53:15 SPK_2
Like, if I have improved more forward, I think I am also interested in contributing more actively in the project.

00:53:24 SPK_2
I don't know, as a monitor or something.

00:53:26 SPK_2
But then I would no longer be linked to the university.

00:53:29 SPK_1
No, it's quiet.

00:53:30 SPK_1
This is not a problem, no.

00:53:32 SPK_1
Just want to want, to want to, finally, do something.

00:53:38 SPK_1
I think it's a construction, right from the community, to exchange experiences.

00:53:44 SPK_1
I think the experience you lived in the course is enough to help us with the monitor, for example, of a next project.

00:53:55 SPK_1
Beauty?

00:53:55 SPK_1
Anything...

00:53:57 SPK_1
Send a message there that we talk, beauty?

00:54:03 SPK_2
Beauty.

00:54:04 SPK_1
It's in hand then, it was worth, until any day.

00:54:06 SPK_1
It cost.

00:54:08 SPK_2
Good luck in your work.

00:54:10 SPK_1
Thanks, he said.

00:54:10 SPK_1
He spoke.
