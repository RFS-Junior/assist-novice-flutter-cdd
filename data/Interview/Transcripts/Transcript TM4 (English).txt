00:00:03 SPK_1
Well, first thank you for participating in this interview.

00:00:07 SPK_1
The idea is that we have a website of how this CDD process was and based on your opinion, your individual opinion, right?

00:00:19 SPK_1
So, the first thing I start by asking is what was your role within this team?

00:00:25 SPK_1
What did you do there?

00:00:29 SPK_2
Well, good night.

00:00:30 SPK_2
It is a pleasure to be part of this, to be able to contribute.

00:00:42 SPK_2
Well, I see that in the team specifically we had, but we didn't necessarily have a well -tied function.

00:00:52 SPK_2
I saw that each week, because of the administrative process we were using, Scrum, each week was updated.

00:01:03 SPK_2
So, like this, each person took the tasks according to what they know how to do and according to what you think is best.

00:01:14 SPK_2
So, so I didn't necessarily have a specific function.

00:01:20 SPK_2
I see that me and others, in this job, right?

00:01:23 SPK_2
Me and the other developers were at the same level.

00:01:27 SPK_2
So let's say my function I would do was precisely that.

00:01:31 SPK_2
So of course it goes what each person likes to do, right?

00:01:35 SPK_2
I see that what I liked to do was this part of Back-end, connecting to the database.

00:01:41 SPK_2
And, say, make a machine work behind the plans.

00:01:49 SPK_2
Let's say so.

00:01:51 SPK_1
Do you remember any task that marked you in this project, which you worked most, any system functionality you worked most?

00:02:00 SPK_2
Look, there was a task that was the one that took a long time to do, which was thanks to the course instructor that helped me, was precisely to do the very specific authentication of a specific category, to see if the guy was an administrator or not, to Being able to log in to the app that needed to ask for the authorization for the final application manager.

00:02:25 SPK_2
So that was something that complicated me a lot, so it was a very striking task.

00:02:32 SPK_1
Do you think it was difficult by the specifications or level of understanding of the framework's programming?

00:02:41 SPK_2
Yeah, I think it wasn't even very specific because it was a specific profile category that a person created her profile, she selected category that she wanted to enter and just in this category had to ask someone else to ask someone, but I see that she became Even more difficult because of my level of understanding.

00:03:09 SPK_1
I understood.

00:03:09 SPK_2
It did not consider it very unfolded with the programming to be able to think about the processes.

00:03:16 SPK_1
I understood.

00:03:17 SPK_1
Okay, now talking like that more than CDD, at this initial stage of preparation, first of all I really wanted to ask you, how would you explain what CDD is for a co -worker?

00:03:35 SPK_2
I would explain so that the CDD is a way of programming in which the group establishes some points based on points.

00:03:49 SPK_2
That this group cannot pass these points in each class or class determined with the group.

00:04:00 SPK_2
But it is that each point is defined by the functions, the specificities of that language that is used.

00:04:10 SPK_2
So let's say it's a way to program optimized in groups.

00:04:18 SPK_1
I understood.

00:04:18 SPK_1
Do you see a general objective of CBD?

00:04:21 SPK_1
If you were to point out what is the purpose of CBD?

00:04:25 SPK_2
Look, I think the keyword I see is having a more organized and more visible code, let's say so.

00:04:32 SPK_1
I understood.

00:04:34 SPK_1
Within this process you lived, which you experienced with the CDD, you think the CDD activities was something more peaceful, or it was another gradual process, which at first was harder, then it was easier, or some other type of idea?

00:04:53 SPK_2
Yeah, I see it was a process, because the CDD appeared kind of in the middle too, right?

00:04:59 SPK_2
Half as much as it was already in the splendid, it had already been commented, it was something that took a while to gear, at first I see.

00:05:08 SPK_2
Also because it was something few had already heard there, right?

00:05:12 SPK_2
So I see, I think when it was when I stayed, if I'm not mistaken, it was six weeks of course, right?

00:05:19 SPK_2
If I am not mistaken, you can give the specific part.

00:05:23 SPK_2
more or less.

00:05:26 SPK_2
I see that there for the second week more or less was when the gear started to work and I see that the team as a whole started programming already thinking about the CDD.

00:05:37 SPK_2
So much so that in the beginning there were still mistakes and such.

00:05:41 SPK_2
I like that I see in the end that we had to make some change in the end I remember that we understood, but there was a little ...

00:05:53 SPK_2
We pack up, say, like a group, in the general world, to make the populations.

00:06:01 SPK_2
I see that we understood, but had a little difficulty in the application, indeed.

00:06:06 SPK_2
We will realize this more for the end.

00:06:09 SPK_1
The difficulties you see that the group had.

00:06:14 SPK_2
Identify where it points out or not punctuates that complexity table.

00:06:26 SPK_2
So much so that there were some situations that we didn't think it fits.

00:06:34 SPK_2
I don't know if because the lack of experience even with the programming language, with the framework specifically.

00:06:42 SPK_2
I see, I don't know if it was that too, that we with some terms we couldn't differentiate, so we ended up curling.

00:06:48 SPK_2
But we did not count and that in the end, when you went to count, saw that there were many more points than we thought we had.

00:06:58 SPK_1
I understood.

00:07:00 SPK_1
Do you think you should have had more time to explain each item, to discuss the table more?

00:07:09 SPK_2
I don't see that longer, but I think something easier, maybe another explanation.

00:07:18 SPK_2
Perhaps a more illustrative little material, maybe.

00:07:25 SPK_2
For example, as we are helping Flutter do something more often, for us it's kind of obvious, but only in an example.

00:07:33 SPK_2
Suppose, something that scored in complexity, use Column and use Row.

00:07:44 SPK_2
For us it was kind of obvious, but there were other things that maybe for us was not so obvious, so maybe take a print of the code, Oh, it fits here.

00:07:53 SPK_2
So when you are going to program and you have to use it here, such as synchronous programming concepts, like Sync, just an example, this here scores so much with something more visual.

00:08:08 SPK_2
I think a material for us to have visited more over time, more explanatory.

00:08:16 SPK_1
I understood.

00:08:17 SPK_1
Did you have access to the examples that were made available?

00:08:23 SPK_1
The same code examples?

00:08:26 SPK_2
Look, I remember I was on the call, on the screen review, which was explained several times.

00:08:34 SPK_2
I was present.

00:08:37 SPK_2
All sprints and such.

00:08:38 SPK_1
OK.

00:08:42 SPK_1
When was the CDD more useful and when it was less useful in your vision?

00:08:45 SPK_2
I think he was more useful in the unfolding of the thing.

00:08:51 SPK_2
When we were already programming, right?

00:08:57 SPK_2
Already programming, so like that, we were already ...

00:08:59 SPK_2
We were already going to code.

00:09:02 SPK_2
Already thinking, Oh, we have to use it, this, this, so, so.

00:09:06 SPK_2
But I think it was no less useful for some attributes anyway, in general, that I see.

00:09:13 SPK_2
That was not, perhaps, only opens in the PDF, effectively, but ...

00:09:19 SPK_2
It's in some categories, so that I see, you know?

00:09:23 SPK_2
So much so that I see that we managed, even in a way, taking it, filtering better, using the Column and the Arrow that took it later, for example.

00:09:36 SPK_1
I understood.

00:09:37 SPK_1
Did you have any specific step that you liked the CDB best?

00:09:43 SPK_2
Man, I think they all were ...

00:09:46 SPK_2
Anyway, I didn't feel a difference between the steps in terms of liking it or not, for me it was similar.

00:09:53 SPK_1
I understood.

00:09:55 SPK_1
Looking at this latest version of the table, right, and her construction was in consensus with the group and everything, but if it was just depending on you, looking at this table of the last version, you agree with all this table, with all the Items you have there, or would you make any change?

00:10:14 SPK_2
No, I'm according to her.

00:10:19 SPK_2
I think this last table was fine ...

00:10:23 SPK_2
A little marrado was really cohesive, you know?

00:10:27 SPK_2
I think it was fine with what we were doing.

00:10:30 SPK_1
During this process, now in group, deciding what ICPs would be, do you remember whether you had a lot of opinion division about which ICP should or should not enter?

00:10:42 SPK_1
No.

00:10:44 SPK_2
At this point I saw that everyone was in consensus.

00:10:48 SPK_2
I don't know why.

00:10:50 SPK_2
I saw that there were people who already knew how to program a lot, but I also saw people who didn't know so much.

00:10:55 SPK_2
So I think that halfway we arrived in an easy consensus.

00:10:59 SPK_1
I understood.

00:11:01 SPK_1
I will use the same example that I am using for everyone, which is to be more specific in this question.

00:11:06 SPK_1
When I'm going to buy a shirt, I have some criteria to choose a shirt that I will buy.

00:11:12 SPK_1
I choose a color that I will like, one size, if I want more fair or wider.

00:11:18 SPK_1
I choose her style, if it's a polo shirt, if it's a stream shirt, something.

00:11:25 SPK_1
These are the criteria that I choose to choose a shirt, the criteria I have to choose a shirt.

00:11:31 SPK_1
What criteria would you use or what criteria did you use to define an ICP?

00:11:35 SPK_1
What criteria?

00:11:44 SPK_2
Look, I see that something that came to me a lot in my head, something to want to talk about at the time, it was very many times that element appeared.

00:11:56 SPK_2
To define the level of complexity, right?

00:12:00 SPK_2
It would be more complex or would be less complex.

00:12:02 SPK_1
I understood.

00:12:03 SPK_1
It's the frequency it appears in the code, is that it?

00:12:06 SPK_2
That, exactly.

00:12:07 SPK_1
Do you have any examples, so, ICP that was used and that you thought there?

00:12:14 SPK_2
I think, for example, taking the CP from Flutter version 3 of the last, I see that a lot, the branches and loops right, if, else, for, while and such.

00:12:29 SPK_2
I understood.

00:12:32 SPK_1
Ok, when you were there in your development process, I was coding there, doing some functionality, how did you use the CP table?

00:12:43 SPK_1
It was like a constant map, which while you developed, you kept looking at the table, looking at the items and already adding?

00:12:51 SPK_1
Or did you just do it at the end of this process, just looked at the table from time to time?

00:12:56 SPK_1
How was it?

00:12:58 SPK_2
Well, I already went to the code thinking more or less what I had to use, a lot or little.

00:13:04 SPK_2
But I had some situations, for example, in the example I gave to ask for authentication and everything.

00:13:13 SPK_2
There was things I saw that I couldn't save so much, I don't think because it was used, like Provider, for example.

00:13:19 SPK_2
So it was something I already had in mind, which had a limit to use, but I couldn't save so much.

00:13:27 SPK_2
But I see a lot in the sense that I was already thinking like that, I can't use much, I can't be that comfortable.

00:13:34 SPK_2
Also because it does not make the code so ...

00:13:40 SPK_2
It doesn't make a code as cleaner, right?

00:13:43 SPK_1
This deepening of items, for example, we have the item asynchronous functions, which for example has a specification, a subdivision of creating and manipulating.

00:13:55 SPK_1
For example, we also have there in state management, we have Change notifier and consumer, for example.

00:14:03 SPK_1
Do you think that being deeper, making this subdivision improves the understanding of items, improves the practice of serving?

00:14:11 SPK_1
Or do you think a unification would be better?

00:14:14 SPK_2
No, I think in this case, I found it interesting to make the division.

00:14:20 SPK_2
As much as it is similar, but it's a way to use it, right?

00:14:25 SPK_2
So, I think joining everything can be kind of ...

00:14:28 SPK_2
It can't be so good, so cool.

00:14:31 SPK_1
I understood.

00:14:34 SPK_1
In this process we had three versions, right?

00:14:36 SPK_1
The first version, the second, which was more or less there in the middle, and the third that came out last week.

00:14:44 SPK_1
So I think this constant refinement process had in the table, these various versions, was it something that hindered or was helping the team more to understand the CDD?

00:14:57 SPK_2
So, not that it got in the way, but I think at the beginning in itself, we didn't know how to manage, right?

00:15:06 SPK_2
For many from there, I think until the first contact.

00:15:12 SPK_2
But I see that if you get the whole project in the long run, everything, it was something that helped us better understand.

00:15:22 SPK_2
So, seeing, of course, my view that I am having, particularly, right?

00:15:25 SPK_2
I was not a guy who developed a lot, right?

00:15:30 SPK_2
I didn't have much, like, protagonism only I saw, so it was a lot and I went from one to another, right?

00:15:37 SPK_1
I understood.

00:15:39 SPK_1
Was there a moment that you left Caesar aside?

00:15:41 SPK_1
Like, he forgot, he silenced and then complained?

00:15:47 SPK_2
No, it has not come to that moment.

00:15:50 SPK_2
As I said like this, I'm not a guy who develops so much, so I see that the parts I made was already in mind.

00:15:57 SPK_2
And because I didn't need to use so much.

00:15:59 SPK_1
I understood.

00:16:01 SPK_1
Did you have to reflect classes because of that?

00:16:04 SPK_2
No, I didn't have to do that.

00:16:11 SPK_1
Beauty.

00:16:12 SPK_1
And then we are also trying to understand what benefits the CDD may have provided, or not.

00:16:18 SPK_1
And the first question about this theme, I was wondering if you can see a positive impact of using CDD within this project.

00:16:28 SPK_1
What would be the positive impact if it has it?

00:16:32 SPK_2
Dude, I see so that the positive impact, because there in that bar of people, say that group of people, where they were not experienced people, many people were at the beginning of the course yet, it was not on vacation now, but everyone is at the beginning of the course.

00:16:49 SPK_2
I think it was very good for us to understand how real life works, let's say, in the real market, to understand that things are not the way in our head, that many companies, groups, have some rules of as their programs develop.

00:17:09 SPK_2
So for us to understand how it works.

00:17:10 SPK_2
In the case of our project was the CDD, right?

00:17:14 SPK_2
But as there are also other methods that I see that is important as well.

00:17:18 SPK_2
I think his help, this positive impact was in this sense, to help us to see how to work as a team, how to work in a company, for example, that has a programming method and everything.

00:17:35 SPK_1
You think that, in fact, in the project code, in the codes you developed or that you observed your colleagues in this work, do you think the code really became easier using CBD?

00:17:48 SPK_1
Was the code more readable, for example?

00:17:51 SPK_2
A little more, I see it, it got a little more, as it was too, it involves a little, I see everyone's lack of experience, but good too, it was very bulky, very big many things.

00:18:01 SPK_2
You could be something, more leares, but whether or not it is still within the cognitive burden, it is inside, but it was still very bulky.

00:18:12 SPK_2
I understood.

00:18:14 SPK_2
And I observed it, I can't watch so easy either, because I'm not a more experienced guy to be able to watch it, but even talking to you and seeing it.

00:18:23 SPK_2
Even then, with everything in the charges that has to be, all done, refactor, still had things that could give a bigger wipe.

00:18:35 SPK_1
I understood.

00:18:35 SPK_1
So, in this case, do you think it also missed more time for project and to refine?

00:18:42 SPK_2
Ah, this is for sure.

00:18:45 SPK_1
I understood.

00:18:46 SPK_2
The project was an intensive, so, at no cost, you know?

00:18:51 SPK_1
I understood.

00:18:52 SPK_1
So you didn't refact, right?

00:18:57 SPK_1
How would you measure the success of the CDD?

00:19:00 SPK_1
What indicator would I say, O CDD was a success?

00:19:04 SPK_1
Do you really did what he set out to do?

00:19:08 SPK_1
Or do you think no, he didn't do what he did in the project?

00:19:16 SPK_2
I think it came to do what had to be done, right?

00:19:19 SPK_2
Which is auxiliary in the lean programming, let's say, right?

00:19:23 SPK_2
Optimized, you can say so.

00:19:26 SPK_2
Help us visualize things as well.

00:19:29 SPK_2
This is something cool that I found.

00:19:30 SPK_2
We help us visualize when doing the development.

00:19:35 SPK_2
But I see that a lot, I think in the end, the more people's account, you know?

00:19:43 SPK_2
The guys talking ...

00:19:43 SPK_2
Can continue.

00:19:45 SPK_2
No, that's not right, I think more people talk, put, mass, no, that's right.

00:19:51 SPK_2
I understood what it was, or see, for example, that we saw, right, in the dailies, even in the split review, people, so, I did such a thing, but then I identified that it wasn't inside Cognitive load, or could not use it, was out of the table, so I had to redo.

00:20:10 SPK_2
I think this also shows that people understood that what it was and how it does.

00:20:17 SPK_1
I understood.

00:20:24 SPK_1
So we'll talk.

00:20:26 SPK_1
Ah, a question that I remembered now, that I think is important.

00:20:31 SPK_1
From what you were talking about, do you feel CBD had a good acceptance in the group?

00:20:37 SPK_1
Both on your part, individually, and from the first you accepted the CBD, talked about the approach, the activities and the group as well.

00:20:46 SPK_1
I think the general feeling was acceptance or did you see any resistance or had any resistance to using this approach?

00:20:56 SPK_2
Dude, I thought it was all kind of surprise, so we weren't planning, right?

00:20:59 SPK_2
Come, say, between the general and the specific part, right?

00:21:04 SPK_2
But I see that there was not much resistance from people, right?

00:21:09 SPK_2
It was something very quiet, so.

00:21:15 SPK_1
And on your part, also the same thing?

00:21:17 SPK_2
Yes yes.

00:21:22 SPK_1
In the beginning the CDD did it make sense already right or take a long time to understand?

00:21:29 SPK_2
No, no, no.

00:21:30 SPK_2
It was something that I took a while to understand.

00:21:34 SPK_2
There was the lecture of the boy he made with us and to me he said, spoke, and I did not understand what it was.

00:21:41 SPK_2
He talked more about the benefits, but it wasn't specific, right?

00:21:46 SPK_2
Soon after you came from the explanation I understood more to what I was really served, right?

00:21:50 SPK_2
What it was.

00:21:51 SPK_2
But it took me a long time to understand this cognitive load relationship, of complexity.

00:22:00 SPK_2
I went to understand more there for the second week.

00:22:03 SPK_1
I understood.

00:22:03 SPK_1
Do you think using CDD complicates the project more?

00:22:07 SPK_1
If I didn't have CDD, it wouldn't be anymore.

00:22:09 SPK_2
Easy to ...

00:22:10 SPK_2
Ah, that's that I think for sure.

00:22:13 SPK_2
Like, what the crowd was going to do, let's say in freestyle, right?

00:22:18 SPK_2
More compensation.

00:22:20 SPK_2
It does not leave something so much more organized for the future.

00:22:22 SPK_2
If we look at this code from here, I don't know, a year, two years, maybe continuing to study, in the focus there, there will be a personal advance.

00:22:32 SPK_2
When you go back, I think if you look at a CDD and CDD code, it will surely understand the code much better with the CDD.

00:22:40 SPK_1
I understood.

00:22:43 SPK_1
Is there anything from the CDD that you think it should be easier, that could be easier?

00:22:52 SPK_2
I don't think I know if CDD specifically, but I think it's more a slightly larger breakdown of each item, the descriptions, you know?

00:23:03 SPK_2
I thought it was more, not the method itself, you know?

00:23:06 SPK_1
I understood.

00:23:09 SPK_1
Is there a moment that the CDD was inappropriate?

00:23:13 SPK_2
Man, let me remember now, no.

00:23:17 SPK_2
In fact, so to arrive a third version of the table, it was never because there was, right?

00:23:23 SPK_2
So, so there were moments that I saw here, especially who is getting their hands in the same way, so, felt.

00:23:31 SPK_2
But in general, I can't say specifically much, right?

00:23:34 SPK_2
I think the classic, to talk again, right?

00:23:37 SPK_2
It's the columns and lines, right?

00:23:41 SPK_2
Of the columns and the rope.

00:23:44 SPK_2
But there was also the other ...

00:23:47 SPK_1
OK.

00:23:49 SPK_1
Would you use CDD in future projects?

00:23:52 SPK_2
Yes.

00:23:53 SPK_2
Yes.

00:23:54 SPK_2
For sure.

00:23:55 SPK_2
It's something I think is a differential in the market too, man.

00:23:59 SPK_2
When you learn to develop with some method or something, it differentiates you.

00:24:05 SPK_2
It thinks of better solutions, you know?

00:24:06 SPK_1
I understood.

00:24:12 SPK_1
If a friend of yours who wanted to use CDD came to ask for a tip, which tip would you give him to improve his performance using the CDD?

00:24:26 SPK_2
What advice would I give to a friend, brother?

00:24:31 SPK_2
Sorry, do it again?

00:24:35 SPK_1
If a friend of yours came to ask you for a tip or advice to use CDD, how to do these activities, which tip did you realize that you would give it?

00:24:48 SPK_2
Dude, first of all I was going to talk, look bro, take this table and study it.

00:24:52 SPK_2
What does each thing mean, unravel, understand how you use it, right?

00:24:57 SPK_2
This also requires having a greater mastery of the Christian language framework.

00:25:02 SPK_2
And like that, you'll already, before you go, already write on paper or do one, say, a mini script of what you are going to do.

00:25:11 SPK_2
Then when to develop, to do the application, you are already thinking about what to do, thinking about the CDD, what you can use and what you can't.

00:25:23 SPK_2
And when you try, it's always the best to do that.

00:25:31 SPK_1
Is there anything you would improve if you were going to use it later?

00:25:37 SPK_1
Any step that would you improve or that would you remove?

00:25:41 SPK_2
No, I think it was according to.

00:25:47 SPK_1
Beauty.

00:25:48 SPK_1
There is any questions I didn't ask, but that you find it interesting to bring to us?

00:25:53 SPK_1
Any knowledge, any thoughts to share?

00:25:56 SPK_1
Anything?

00:25:59 SPK_2
No, I think seeing that way right in the face is not really.

00:26:02 SPK_2
I think it was very interesting, so, giving you again for the thousandth time to you, but it was very cool, that's right.

00:26:12 SPK_2
As much as we wrapped around a little at first, there was those doubts, but I see it was very important for us to understand, even, for example, I see that I am not very deeply with everyone, but I see that for me it was to understand how it works, you know?

00:26:27 SPK_2
So I think of course, of course, there is always something to improve, right?

00:26:37 SPK_2
Maybe even in the explanation of every thing, but I think that's it, I think that's right, right?

00:26:46 SPK_1
Beauty.

00:26:47 SPK_1
So, thank you for participating in this interview.

00:26:51 SPK_1
It will be very useful for both me and researchers who are interested in the area and want to understand what was the context of what happened.

00:26:59 SPK_1
I think you help bring insights to us who are trying to better understand this approach.

00:27:06 SPK_1
And that's it, if you have any suggestions, any thoughts, or something you remember later, you answer on Whatsapp, to send you a message when you remember something.

00:27:20 SPK_2
And that's it, I want to thank you, thank you so much for participating.

00:27:23 SPK_2
Thank you.

00:27:24 SPK_2
Thanks, saw bro, it was a mass opportunity, so, man.

00:27:26 SPK_2
Even mass, like this.

00:27:28 SPK_2
Even I will talk, if you want to do another course of floating on vacation there, apply this method, I will be the guy who will talk, fuck, go, bro, subscribe there, will be fucking, you know?

00:27:38 SPK_1
Legal.

00:27:39 SPK_1
Beauty, so it was worth everything.

00:27:43 SPK_2
It's us, bro.
