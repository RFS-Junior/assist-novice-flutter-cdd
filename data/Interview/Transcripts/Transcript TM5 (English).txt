00:00:04 SPK_1
Well, come on.

00:00:06 SPK_1
First, thank you for participating in the interview.

00:00:10 SPK_1
And then I wanted to start first asking you how have you been working with Flutter lately?

00:00:17 SPK_1
How have you been included in your studies?

00:00:21 SPK_1
Or have you been to another language?

00:00:23 SPK_1
Given a stop?

00:00:24 SPK_2
Lately, since we finished the project, I've stopped because I'm in the course of course.

00:00:33 SPK_2
Then we have an integrating project to integrate, it is to deliver in the case.

00:00:38 SPK_2
So I had to go back to my base that is more java.

00:00:43 SPK_2
So I have been working mainly with Java and web programming that is HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

00:00:50 SPK_2
Then at Flutter I stopped like this.

00:00:53 SPK_2
But still once in a while I see some videos on the internet like this just to know if it is new or not.

00:01:00 SPK_2
But during this time I'm stopped with the Flutter.

00:01:03 SPK_1
I understood.

00:01:05 SPK_1
There in the project, the practical project we played, what was your role there?

00:01:09 SPK_1
What activities did you do?

00:01:13 SPK_2
I, in the project, was initially protected to the web project phase, but as it did not closed a certain group, I ended up migrating along with the people who remained for this mobile project.

00:01:28 SPK_2
My role, along with two more people, was the visual part, the front end of the project.

00:01:35 SPK_2
So I worked with these people.

00:01:38 SPK_2
My main function was to encode the page, in this case, the front end of the page.

00:01:48 SPK_2
And the other two people took care of other artifacts.

00:01:51 SPK_2
And in this case it was the prototyping of wireframes and also a study of leather palettes and their care.

00:01:58 SPK_1
Do you remember a feature that you worked a lot, that marked for you in this project?

00:02:02 SPK_1
A function, a specific feature?

00:02:07 SPK_2
I just remember ...

00:02:10 SPK_2
I think only ...

00:02:12 SPK_2
I wanted to implement a lot of animations in the case of the project, but I couldn't implement any despite studying some.

00:02:23 SPK_2
But I really wanted to have been able to implement some animations in the project, but unfortunately I couldn't, but this was the one that most marked me because I saw several, several libraries of how other projects slightly larger, worked with these animations and I found more interesting.

00:02:46 SPK_1
I got it, ok.

00:02:46 SPK_1
How would you explain the CDD for a colleague of yours?

00:02:51 SPK_2
I would explain that it is a way to organize in a project.

00:03:00 SPK_2
For example, CDD, I will say that it is a technique that the programmer uses with some questions, in this case, which would be some ICP points that would be rates of complexity of a class or even a code.

00:03:20 SPK_2
So, would I say, oh, what is CDD, John?

00:03:23 SPK_2
Ask me.

00:03:24 SPK_2
Man, it's a way to work.

00:03:27 SPK_2
In this case, there is the study of the class that you meet with your team and then you talk to your team if some development points are difficult or more complex.

00:03:42 SPK_2
In this case, they are complex or easier in this case.

00:03:45 SPK_2
Then you would enumerate the most difficult points with larger numbers for example 3 to 5 and the easiest points from 1 to 2 for example.

00:03:54 SPK_2
And that's that would basically be the CDD a way to integrate into your project is a way to follow in your project.

00:04:08 SPK_2
In the case of control that you would have about your project in the case.

00:04:14 SPK_2
a way to control the project complexity index.

00:04:18 SPK_1
OK.

00:04:18 SPK_1
During your project experience, you think CDD was quiet, was it easy to understand or was another gradual journey that gradually understood the concepts, the activities?

00:04:31 SPK_1
How was your experience?

00:04:34 SPK_2
Right at first, well, well, at the beginning, at the beginning of the project, I didn't have much not had this view of why using the CDD in the project was not making much difference during my participation in the project at least for me In my view he would not make much difference if he was there or not but then when it was so ending in half until the end of the project then I understood why we were using the CDD so at first it was not so relevant So for me, but he started to get important from half the project when the codes were becoming bigger and the repository was growing constantly.

00:05:26 SPK_1
I understood.

00:05:27 SPK_1
Do you think the CDD was more useful or less useful?

00:05:31 SPK_1
Do you think he was more beneficial to the team or do you think he hindered?

00:05:40 SPK_2
In a way, he was beneficial.

00:05:44 SPK_2
He was no more evil than beneficial, but if he is choosing between the two, he was beneficial, yes.

00:05:51 SPK_1
Why?

00:05:54 SPK_2
Because, for example, we were kind of had a vision while we were programming or after we finished programming work, in this case, that we were careful to be careful to understand our code .

00:06:16 SPK_2
For example, we would be careful, for example, if we built a crazy code of several lines like this, many functions, and there is no use only the person who is programming to understand the code, if the other person who arrives and see , hit the eye, you will not understand.

00:06:33 SPK_2
So, that's why he was important, that he works this part of you being careful not to go beyond the limits that are imposed before with your team, to talk and see what are the most complex points or not.

00:06:48 SPK_2
So, in a way, it was very important because of that.

00:06:51 SPK_1
Beauty.

00:06:52 SPK_1
Did you have any stage you liked the most throughout the process with CBD?

00:07:01 SPK_2
I don't think so, because ...

00:07:05 SPK_2
In this case, as I worked on the project's front end, so I worked very little with the back end demand that the people who worked in this part had more activity and they also had to implement more things, more filters than me At first I was unaware.

00:07:29 SPK_2
So, as I worked hard this part of the front end, my complexity rates, they were very low.

00:07:39 SPK_2
So, for me, he was not ...

00:07:41 SPK_2
He did not disturb so much, because he had even some complexity rates, they were removed, because they made no sense in the project.

00:07:53 SPK_2
Because everyone would understand and everything.

00:07:57 SPK_1
What indices do you think you impacted on the table, on your process of developing with front end?

00:08:08 SPK_2
Asynchronous function.

00:08:11 SPK_2
Asynchronous function, especially the string part.

00:08:17 SPK_2
I think the asynchronous widgets too, I think they were very few, because I used very little in the programming.

00:08:24 SPK_2
But these two, asynchronous function and the asynchronous IDECT.

00:08:30 SPK_1
Looking at the final table, what did you think of this table?

00:08:34 SPK_1
You agree with everything that was the last table, the third version, the final table?

00:08:43 SPK_2
I agree that I had the basic and animated IDECT withdrawal too, the implicit and explicit animations, because we didn't use it.

00:08:53 SPK_2
And the basic widgets, I also agreed that it was removed because as we had the wireframes of what the project would look like, we did not have this discussion during the development part during that time, but I agree that what remained.

00:09:17 SPK_2
I would have taken it, like, would have diminished the complexity part of asynchronous functions.

00:09:23 SPK_2
Creating and manipulating could have been 1 and 1, instead of 1 and 2.

00:09:29 SPK_2
But other than that, there is a coherent table.

00:09:32 SPK_1
Do you think the basic edit, at the beginning of the table, helped, really offered an impact to you, or not?

00:09:42 SPK_1
I think it never made sense of this item.

00:09:46 SPK_2
No, it made sense because as my trajectory with Flutter, for example, I didn't know this language, I learned this year from the holiday course.

00:09:56 SPK_2
So he made sense yes because as we were in a development environment and with development comes the practice, at first it made sense because I was not so used to him daily.

00:10:09 SPK_2
But as we were taking experience during this process, so he made sense yes at the beginning and also makes sense he was removed.

00:10:22 SPK_1
I understood.

00:10:23 SPK_1
Is there any item that you would change, add or remove from this table?

00:10:32 SPK_2
What was removed was what I would remove, which is the item I had excited, because we could not implement the project due to time.

00:10:41 SPK_2
And as it has already been removed, so everything is ok.

00:10:44 SPK_1
There are any item we didn't think, that was not in the suggestion table, that we didn't argue, that you personally think you could come in?

00:10:57 SPK_2
I don't think so.

00:10:59 SPK_2
Also, for example, at the beginning of Table 1, which had been the purpose of being thought about lip variable, for example, that he was later it was not implemented in the table in the case that was not so worked on the project.

00:11:17 SPK_2
But if it had been more implemented in the most used case I think it should have special attention.

00:11:27 SPK_2
The variable no.

00:11:30 SPK_1
I am using this similar explanation for everyone, which is as follows, when I go buy a shirt, I like to choose a color I like, I like a size, sometimes I want a tighter or more or more shirt Large, a different style, a social shirt, a polo shirt, any kind.

00:11:52 SPK_1
These are the criteria I use to choose a shirt, to buy me a shirt.

00:11:56 SPK_1
What criteria did you use to choose an ICP item for the ICPS table?

00:12:05 SPK_2
An ICP item for the ICP table, in this case to define the complexity index or define the category item?

00:12:14 SPK_1
The category item.

00:12:18 SPK_2
Well, as we had the meetings, I think in ...

00:12:25 SPK_2
I forgot...

00:12:28 SPK_2
It was in the retrospectives and reviews that it had in the Scrum model that we used.

00:12:35 SPK_2
We sat everyone, me with the people who came from the web team, along with the mobile staff, and we thought about the categories as suggested.

00:12:49 SPK_2
For example, Basic Idect and Animated Idect that was part of the first table.

00:12:56 SPK_2
We should clearly ...

00:12:58 SPK_2
We suggested them because it is part of the look, it is part of the front end.

00:13:05 SPK_2
So, for example, if the people who work with a back-end who don't work so much with the visual part, take our code and come, oh, he used it here, but he used something more visually advanced, I don't understand that.

00:13:21 SPK_2
So they made these suggestions that were implemented in the first table of widgets, they were chosen precisely because they were part of my area, which in this case would be the part of the visual area, front end.

00:13:38 SPK_2
And the same thing happened to what was accepted by the staff as the whole, who was the part of the Back-end staff, which is the mobile part, which would be asynchronous functions, mainly management that web people did not see the management of state.

00:13:54 SPK_2
And how did the Back-end people seen, so we, everyone, was implemented in the table this state management just why?

00:14:03 SPK_2
Because the Back-end people saw, but who?

00:14:06 SPK_2
You didn't see, you should know if it would be complex or not.

00:14:11 SPK_2
And then they were discussed at meetings and everything.

00:14:14 SPK_2
So these were more or less the criteria.

00:14:17 SPK_1
Yeah, but if it were, I speak more of an individual way, if it was just dependent on ...

00:14:22 SPK_1
What criteria would you use to determine which table items are?

00:14:30 SPK_2
I would use, for example, it depends a lot on ...

00:14:35 SPK_2
What the project needs, in this case.

00:14:38 SPK_2
If the project did not need, for example, ...

00:14:42 SPK_2
On the visual part, it would be, for example, a ...

00:14:47 SPK_2
I don't know, just command forninha.

00:14:49 SPK_2
Then it would only use state management and coupling.

00:14:54 SPK_2
But as he needed a visual part, so I would suggest, and it was also suggested, Idex.

00:15:01 SPK_2
The basic, excited and asynchronous Idex.

00:15:04 SPK_2
These would be the criteria.

00:15:05 SPK_2
Because it will always depend on each project, what each project will need.

00:15:10 SPK_2
For example, if it were a visual project, it would not even need state management, let alone coupling and asynchronous function.

00:15:17 SPK_2
So that's what I suggest according to what I think for a project.

00:15:26 SPK_2
And in the case of this ...

00:15:27 SPK_2
Yes, yes, yes.

00:15:28 SPK_1
You can continue, you can continue.

00:15:30 SPK_2
In the case of this project we had, all the categories that were suggested made sense, both at the beginning and also both at the end.

00:15:41 SPK_1
OK.

00:15:42 SPK_1
In the process of building the table, you remember if there was a lot of disagreement of the team or most of the time there was a consensus on the items, about the cost that was implemented?

00:15:55 SPK_2
Most of the time there was a consensus.

00:15:58 SPK_2
For example, there was a moment I had, I don't remember which one, but there was a category that we wanted to lower the complexity rate, but as we were not sure to lower like this or not, we decided to keep it, that I think it was Asynchronous function or state management, one of these two categories.

00:16:22 SPK_2
So, most, in this case, among the table of the first version, both the last, were kept based on the safety of everyone on the team.

00:16:33 SPK_2
So if we were not safe, we decided to keep what was proposed before.

00:16:43 SPK_1
What criterion would you use to define the cost of an item?

00:16:47 SPK_1
For example, in the table, we have the IF which has a cost of 1, which are brands and loopers.

00:16:54 SPK_1
And we also have asynchronous functions there.

00:16:58 SPK_1
Asynchronous functions manipulation has a cost of 2 ECP.

00:17:01 SPK_1
What is the criterion you use to define the different cost for different items?

00:17:08 SPK_2
Experience.

00:17:12 SPK_2
If the person has a lot of experience, for example, let's suppose, oh, have experience in everything, then that person will have the criterion, like, ah, they can all be one, or do not even put, for example, brands and loops, which It's so easy.

00:17:27 SPK_2
So the criterion I use, and I think I use it forward too, is always experience.

00:17:32 SPK_2
But then, of course, you have to do with everyone on the team.

00:17:35 SPK_2
It's no use just having an experience in everything, knowing everything, and of course there is no person without.

00:17:42 SPK_2
but the criterion that uses the experience.

00:17:46 SPK_1
I understood.

00:17:47 SPK_1
When you were there developing the codes, the CP table, was it often consulted or was it another guide that you looked from time to time?

00:17:58 SPK_2
She was a guide I looked from time to time, especially in the development area because I always checked her after finishing that part I was developing.

00:18:10 SPK_2
Because as I worked, as I said, how I worked with the visual part of the project, so there was things there that was not even part of ...

00:18:20 SPK_2
That I didn't even need to consult, in this case, in the table, which was not the case with basic widgets that were removed.

00:18:28 SPK_2
And especially the part of brands and loops, when I needed to do some ...

00:18:33 SPK_2
Using some if or an ethus, even one, so I used it very little because I knew I, for example, was not developing something that cost a little more CP, for example, state management or asynchronous functions.

00:18:52 SPK_1
OK.

00:18:52 SPK_1
You think this process of having three table versions, right?

00:18:56 SPK_1
We had one at the beginning, more or less in the half we had a second version and for the last week of the refactor had the final version.

00:19:04 SPK_1
Do you think this process always stopping once a week and reviewing the table is a process that it helps the most or it gets in the way to codar using the CDD?

00:19:17 SPK_2
It helps.

00:19:19 SPK_2
And it helps because, for example, he ends up asking you anyway if that item makes sense for example he also shows you whether you learned something else or gained more experience in that step during a table and another then it helps a lot even to even to Understand if the project he improved or worsened during these development steps.

00:19:49 SPK_1
There in your process of Codar, do the codes for implementation, how was your process of identifying, pointing and calculating a CP of a class?

00:19:59 SPK_1
How did you do this?

00:20:07 SPK_2
I always left the point of, what I knew and than I thought was harder.

00:20:12 SPK_2
For example, I will give the example of state management, which we had not seen right in the web part, which I came from the web course, not the mobile course.

00:20:23 SPK_2
So, as I did not participate in the specific course, the state management part for me was harder, even because I had not researched anything about.

00:20:32 SPK_2
So I saw an average of what was farther for me to implement and what was easier.

00:20:42 SPK_2
As we cannot define zero, for example, and always integers, so clearly I would define that the easiest number would be 1.

00:20:52 SPK_2
And, for example, in the part of asynchronous functions and state management.

00:20:58 SPK_2
The creation part is always easier.

00:21:00 SPK_2
So I would also define it is an easier number of all.

00:21:06 SPK_2
Already the part that demands a little more to know a little more of that category.

00:21:11 SPK_2
Then we would increase to three or two.

00:21:15 SPK_2
Why is not in Table 3 for example in the manipulation part.

00:21:20 SPK_2
Because it was one.

00:21:23 SPK_2
He was.

00:21:24 SPK_2
It was implemented with the entire team talked.

00:21:27 SPK_2
So as most were there speaking does not put two that two is enough.

00:21:35 SPK_2
So we everyone decided together to put two for that category.

00:21:40 SPK_1
I talk more about the activities.

00:21:43 SPK_1
What are CDD activities, for example, in the codar part?

00:21:46 SPK_1
It is you identify an ICP within a class, for example, you will look at the table, I think, you will look at the table, look at the code and identify this ICP.

00:21:57 SPK_1
Then you will point him to tell the Team that he has an ICP.

00:22:01 SPK_1
And then you will calculate this class to see what is the total load of this class.

00:22:08 SPK_1
How was your process?

00:22:09 SPK_1
Did you do just like I'm talking or had something that was different?

00:22:16 SPK_2
That's it, that's how you said.

00:22:18 SPK_2
When we were developing, for example, and we would point in a case of the class.

00:22:22 SPK_2
We always took care not to burst the maximum cognitive load.

00:22:27 SPK_2
Which was defined in that table.

00:22:31 SPK_2
So when we had ...

00:22:33 SPK_2
When we saw that, for example, there was a table that had ...

00:22:36 SPK_2
That was bursting, that had ...

00:22:38 SPK_2
It is, for example, abusive categories within a class, for example, within a file.

00:22:43 SPK_2
So we would warn that we would have to refact.

00:22:47 SPK_1
Do you remember if there was any class that was challenging to do this?

00:22:49 SPK_1
Was it hard to calculate, identify?

00:22:55 SPK_2
In my part of development, no.

00:22:58 SPK_1
Was it always quiet and such?

00:23:01 SPK_2
Yes.

00:23:02 SPK_2
Because I also always took the parts that were usually already refined.

00:23:08 SPK_2
So, as my part was to implement the visual part, I worked with categories that would not have to be accounted for in that class.

00:23:16 SPK_2
So they would not change the cognitive load of the class.

00:23:23 SPK_1
OK I understand.

00:23:23 SPK_1
So, you always took a class that she was ready and then you had to put the visual part more.

00:23:30 SPK_2
Was that?

00:23:33 SPK_2
A priori yes because sometimes there was class that was not ready yet and I already wanted to implement the visual part.

00:23:39 SPK_2
So I was already refracting to the person.

00:23:43 SPK_2
Even when the person forgot to account for.

00:23:47 SPK_2
So I made this count to see if I was bursting or not.

00:23:51 SPK_2
Then you were bursting, I would warn you and leave for another class other than that, because I didn't want to mess with the Back-end code.

00:23:59 SPK_2
Even understanding like this, but I didn't want to change the code because I didn't feel safe.

00:24:06 SPK_2
Did you have any class you had from scratch?

00:24:10 SPK_2
From zero?

00:24:11 SPK_2
There was, only I don't remember now, you have to see there in ...

00:24:16 SPK_2
in the GitHub repository.

00:24:18 SPK_1
But by feeling, we will try to remember the feeling you had.

00:24:23 SPK_1
Do you think building a class from scratch was easier than taking an existing class and applying some part end-end there?

00:24:35 SPK_2
In a way, yes.

00:24:37 SPK_2
Because as the scratch class I already have as I do, in my own way, my own way, in the class that is ready, I take time to analyze what is within that class, that file.

00:24:54 SPK_2
In the zero class, no.

00:24:55 SPK_2
In the zero class, I know where it will be, I know where I'm going to start, when I'm finishing, which I need to change.

00:25:01 SPK_2
This takes a little less time.

00:25:05 SPK_2
Already in ready classes, I have to analyze the class to see what I will implement yes or no.

00:25:10 SPK_1
I understood.

00:25:12 SPK_1
There was some time that you left the CDD aside, which you didn't even think about CDD, just thought about Feature, the code and after you thought about the CDD.

00:25:20 SPK_1
Was there a moment that happened?

00:25:23 SPK_2
At the beginning of the project, that's what happened to me the most, which I left the CDD aside.

00:25:31 SPK_2
Also because it did not change that much, because the project was still at the beginning, so the number of classes was smaller, the number of lines was also much smaller, so I had left the CDD aside.

00:25:43 SPK_2
I went to give him a little more attention.

00:25:45 SPK_1
Sorry, you can continue.

00:25:48 SPK_2
No, I just started paying attention really when the project was growing and becoming a little more complex.

00:25:58 SPK_1
I understood.

00:25:58 SPK_1
What made you drop the CDD by hand at this moment you put it aside?

00:26:04 SPK_2
I did not understand the proposal specifically.

00:26:10 SPK_2
I understood the general proposal, but the specific proposal of what it really is to work with CDD, so I think that's why I had left aside.

00:26:21 SPK_1
OK.

00:26:22 SPK_1
Did you exceed the limit of the classes very often?

00:26:26 SPK_2
Very often not.

00:26:27 SPK_2
Once, I think once or two, I surpassed, which was right at the end of the project that the class was bursting and had many lines of code that needed to be component.

00:26:43 SPK_2
But in general, I didn't exceed that much of the limit, no.

00:26:47 SPK_1
When you saw that a class exceeded the limit, how did you decide that you were critical of solving?

00:26:53 SPK_1
Why did you look and talk, will I solve this part here?

00:26:57 SPK_1
Did you have a pattern?

00:26:59 SPK_2
It had, for example, many repeated lines of the same function, for example.

00:27:06 SPK_2
As I worked hard on the look, I saw that I was repeating many lines that could be component and called in just one line.

00:27:16 SPK_2
So when I finished developing and then came that class and noticed it, I had this concern to soon component that.

00:27:27 SPK_1
Had any ICP that you considered more critical and you paid more attention?

00:27:32 SPK_1
Or that you ...

00:27:32 SPK_1
Usually this ICP here is what I try to component.

00:27:38 SPK_2
The coupling part ...

00:27:40 SPK_2
No, no coupling, sorry.

00:27:42 SPK_2
The part of asynchronous functions.

00:27:45 SPK_1
I understood.

00:27:49 SPK_1
OK.

00:27:50 SPK_1
Do you think the CDD has had a positive impact on the project?

00:27:57 SPK_2
Yes.

00:27:59 SPK_2
I could say only that only in my opinion the CDD it really made a difference from a point that the project it is constantly growing at the beginning of the project in my opinion the CDD it does not make so much difference I think even a little logical of He makes no difference because the person or the group he might think that we are developing right here, not giving any error, so let's continue as soon as it will not give error there for the future.

00:28:34 SPK_2
But the CDD, from the moment the project is on a level of many classes, many files, several folders, the person can even get lost, I don't know, in the repository, and the CDD it kind of helps you stop you To wonder if when you deliver the project when the project is completed any other code reviewer or that the person responsible for future maintenance will be able to do that easier more effectively.

00:29:12 SPK_2
So his CD helps a lot in this part in a positive way in a positive way that the CD is no longer ...

00:29:26 SPK_2
Be kind of an agent who is disturbing you in the case.

00:29:30 SPK_2
Disturbing you so you want to improve.

00:29:34 SPK_1
I understood.

00:29:35 SPK_1
You can see a ...

00:29:36 SPK_1
A negative impact of CBT?

00:29:41 SPK_2
Hmm ...

00:29:44 SPK_2
I think these issues of class limitation, type ...

00:29:49 SPK_2
of you have ...

00:29:51 SPK_2
Although it looks like this, look, they are bursting the class or the person will not understand, it can also be a negative point for him.

00:29:59 SPK_2
Just as it helps you in the part of decreasing the complexity of the code, it is also boring in this part.

00:30:09 SPK_2
This is the only negative point for being boring in this part.

00:30:13 SPK_2
Just a minute.

00:30:16 SPK_2
I went back.

00:30:17 SPK_2
He is found in this part just not allowing to extrapolate.

00:30:23 SPK_2
Do not allow to extrapolate the maximum connective load number.

00:30:29 SPK_2
I understood.

00:30:32 SPK_1
Let's go.

00:30:37 SPK_1
Is there any benefit that in practice have you been able to observe throughout this process?

00:30:43 SPK_1
Personal benefit or the project?

00:30:48 SPK_2
I think the personal benefit would be that I have this concern for developing my code.

00:30:58 SPK_2
Not necessarily to make a cleaner code that everyone will understand, but have the concern that my code will not be what a person will see and will not be able to understand.

00:31:08 SPK_2
Or it will just be something I can solve.

00:31:13 SPK_2
So I think this would be the benefit that the CDD brought to me, especially.

00:31:18 SPK_1
Before the CDB did you not care about it?

00:31:21 SPK_2
I didn't worry as much as today I was already concerned with making a code that I understood myself that in this case I would understand in a while if I stopped in that development but I didn't worry so much about other people if they would understand or not mine.

00:31:40 SPK_1
Code I understand you think the CDD made the code easier to understand in general?

00:31:51 SPK_2
For classes that are calling many functions and other classes as well, for example, dependent classes in the case.

00:32:03 SPK_2
I think in this type of files I think he didn't make it that easy to understand why there would be a person to access this other file that is being called an example of this is the Men file that I was checking here he after the refactor, He got a lot less lines of code and a ...

00:32:30 SPK_2
During his refactor, I noticed that some files were also created that could have been created before, but were not created.

00:32:38 SPK_2
But even so, if a person who was, for example, from this project development of this project, she get this file and read, I think she ...

00:32:48 SPK_2
I could not understand, unless it visited each of these files that are being called in this class.

00:32:56 SPK_2
So at this point, I think the CDD did not facilitate reading.

00:33:03 SPK_2
Even though he does not burst the maximum cognitive load.

00:33:08 SPK_1
I understood.

00:33:11 SPK_1
Do you think CDD offers improvements in code quality?

00:33:16 SPK_1
Did you feel improvements in code quality?

00:33:21 SPK_2
No, I didn't feel.

00:33:24 SPK_1
Did you feel improvements in the readability of the code?

00:33:29 SPK_2
Yes, in readability, yes, but in the quality of the code.

00:33:33 SPK_2
But so it may seem a little kind of controversial, but they are two different things.

00:33:40 SPK_2
Readability and quality of code, both writing and, for example, of indentation.

00:33:49 SPK_1
OK.

00:33:49 SPK_1
Do you think the complexity that the CDD marked there in the classes really represented the complexity you felt?

00:34:02 SPK_2
In general, yes.

00:34:03 SPK_2
Because as the CDD is defined, for example, complexity rates are defined from the team, not just one person.

00:34:14 SPK_2
So, as everyone was in consensus, he made sense, yes.

00:34:18 SPK_2
But individually ...

00:34:19 SPK_2
Also because I gave in, for example, even if I found something, for example, this index here has to be 3 and most said S2, I would have to review later if it really was worth 3.

00:34:34 SPK_2
So, he did ...

00:34:39 SPK_2
He...

00:34:43 SPK_2
That's it, that's what I have to talk about.

00:34:45 SPK_2
I forgot the word he said.

00:34:47 SPK_1
All good.

00:34:50 SPK_1
In general, do you think the CDL was successful in his proposal?

00:34:59 SPK_2
Considering the time defined and stipulated for the project, I don't think so.

00:35:06 SPK_2
Because the project still needed another week to suffer the necessary refactors for the project and the class codes.

00:35:15 SPK_2
So, during the stipulated time and during this time -stipulated time worked, I think it was not 100% succeeded.

00:35:28 SPK_1
OK.

00:35:29 SPK_1
In the beginning, the CDD, did it make sense or was it confused?

00:35:35 SPK_1
When did he start making sense to you?

00:35:40 SPK_2
In the beginning, I just had ...

00:35:44 SPK_2
Listened to what the CDD would be and in this case what we would work and was informed to me.

00:35:53 SPK_2
Only I thought something different for the CDD.

00:35:57 SPK_2
I thought it was supposed to be used on there now and that not his original proposal that is worried that the future is appeared for example an index of complexity.

00:36:11 SPK_2
So at first, for me, he didn't make so much sense.

00:36:14 SPK_2
He began to make sense after the meetings discussed and especially after half of the project.

00:36:21 SPK_1
Do you think the CDD complicated the project?

00:36:23 SPK_1
Complicated even more the project?

00:36:27 SPK_2
In a way, no.

00:36:29 SPK_2
He complicated only in paying attention, right?

00:36:33 SPK_2
Which was more one more concern, it would be another concern in the project of being careful to use it but it was just that, in the concern to use.

00:36:48 SPK_1
OK.

00:36:50 SPK_1
There was something that, some time, something you were doing during the project that CBD, which you thought could be easier, could this part here?

00:37:02 SPK_1
Or did you have any difficulty in any of the processes that you would like to have improvements?

00:37:09 SPK_2
No.

00:37:11 SPK_1
Had any part that you thought the CDD doesn't help much?

00:37:18 SPK_2
At first, only at the beginning of the project.

00:37:22 SPK_1
OK.

00:37:23 SPK_1
Do you think that both you and the team members felt that you had any resistance to apply the CDD, to use it?

00:37:32 SPK_1
Did you have resistance or did you realize that someone in the group, someone from the team or the whole team had resistance with the CDD?

00:37:41 SPK_2
No.

00:37:45 SPK_2
Everyone accepted the CDD proposal.

00:37:47 SPK_2
The existence was only in any timely meeting that was discussed about some complexity rate, but other than that, no.

00:37:59 SPK_1
Would you use CDD in the future?

00:38:04 SPK_2
It depends on the project I would follow.

00:38:07 SPK_2
If it were a project that required a little over time, for example, that was a medium -sized or large project, so.

00:38:18 SPK_2
For example, the proposal of this project that we had, right, of the application.

00:38:23 SPK_2
I think he made sense on the CDD.

00:38:25 SPK_2
I think I would not use, for example, in projects that are short, which would be developed in one to five days, for example, I think these projects would not need CDD implementation.

00:38:42 SPK_2
OK.

00:38:42 SPK_1
If anyone wanted to apply CDD, I knew you already applied CDD on a project, which tip would you give to that person if she came to ask?

00:38:57 SPK_2
I would say it is better to work in groups.

00:39:03 SPK_2
Because if the person is using a CDD alone, I don't think it makes so much sense.

00:39:11 SPK_1
What is the main lesson you would take to the future when using the CDD again?

00:39:22 SPK_2
During my programming and not when I was over because although I used it only when I finished the part I was developing and even for the demand I was doing that it was just the visual part I didn't feel as much effective as I I felt a period later when I went to test it when I was developing and consulting the table to.

00:39:54 SPK_1
OK.

00:39:55 SPK_1
Is there anything that you would improve the CDD approach?

00:40:01 SPK_1
Any implementation, any change that you would make to make this process better, these CDD activities?

00:40:12 SPK_2
I think that...

00:40:14 SPK_2
I don't think so.

00:40:18 SPK_1
Beauty.

00:40:19 SPK_1
Lastly, there's something important that I didn't ask you, but that you think it's pertinent to talk, share, some thought about the CDD?

00:40:32 SPK_2
I just wanted to ask a question to confirm.

00:40:38 SPK_2
For example, in the first table, the maximum cognitive load was 32 points.

00:40:45 SPK_2
The calculation is done as follows, add all CP points and multiplies by 2, isn't it?

00:40:52 SPK_1
Exactly.

00:40:53 SPK_2
And in the last table the maximum cognitive load was 13, but it was not being multiplied by 2.

00:41:02 SPK_1
Is it reduced the items?

00:41:06 SPK_2
Yes.

00:41:08 SPK_1
And made a simple sum of all ICPs.

00:41:12 SPK_2
Oh, yes, they did only the sum, I understood.

00:41:14 SPK_1
This will not be exactly half of what was the first table.

00:41:19 SPK_2
I understood, I understood.

00:41:22 SPK_2
Not because when I had seen the last table I thought hell diminished so much but then I went to make the calculation there he really diminished but it was even scared because it decreased from 32 to 13 we should have done something wrong.

00:41:38 SPK_1
But not ok just for people out of it just for the researchers of the future to understand, did you participate in the last phase of project refactoring?

00:41:54 SPK_2
No, I could not participate in the last phase of refactoring.

00:41:57 SPK_2
Although I wanted to, I could not due to some personal situations and ended up not participating.

00:42:08 SPK_1
Beauty, so thank you for sharing your experience.

00:42:13 SPK_1
It is very important for us to have insights and have references so that we can improve the approach in future projects.

00:42:22 SPK_1
And then, as you know, I'll be available there on WhatsApp.

00:42:25 SPK_1
If you remember something, if you have any thoughts that have not been shared here, you can tell me there on WhatsApp.

00:42:34 SPK_1
And we keep this contact and that's it.

00:42:38 SPK_1
Thank you for participating.

00:42:42 SPK_2
Beauty then.

00:42:43 SPK_2
Thank you there for the opportunity to have participated in this project.

00:42:47 SPK_2
I really liked it.
