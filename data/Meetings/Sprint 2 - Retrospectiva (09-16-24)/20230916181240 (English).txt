00:00:02 SPK_1
Can you already?

00:00:03 SPK_1
He can.

00:00:05 SPK_2
About the CDD, I think the process of accounting for ICP points has already become more fluid, easier to do.

00:00:15 SPK_2
You don't have to be consulting the table so many times, you already have a head link to that.

00:00:20 SPK_2
And something I noticed is that the point limit for a class, which is 32 points, I think it is very high, because the classes I see, many do not even reach 25 points, more or less.

00:00:37 SPK_2
The big ones are about 20 and a few points, but most are less than that.

00:00:42 SPK_2
Then I believe we have to see this limit there.

00:00:46 SPK_2
And one of my opinion is that the basic widgets could be removed from the table, in my opinion.

00:00:55 SPK_2
And that.

00:01:05 SPK_1
Someone more?

00:01:06 SPK_3
If the person wants to talk about put it on the card?

00:01:17 SPK_3
I can talk about.

00:01:18 SPK_3
Regarding the CDD, I thought it is very interesting, like this, we can better visualize what we are using, as we are working on the code but I feel as soon as in the project, in the case we are doing, I think it won't hit the number at the end.

00:01:41 SPK_3
I don't know if it's because of the amount of features or something, you know?

00:01:47 SPK_3
But what caught my attention was this question of being better visualized how we are doing, being able to better visualize what we are using.

00:02:01 SPK_1
Can we comment on the rest too?

00:02:05 SPK_1
No, it's normal.

00:02:07 SPK_1
It starts talking about Sprint and lastly you will see.

00:02:11 SPK_2
Can I just comment on what James said?

00:02:14 SPK_2
For as much as we do not reach this limit of ICP points, I see that still writing these points helps because as he said, kind of gives an overview of what we are doing.

00:02:28 SPK_2
This gives me ideas on how to improve my code, make it perhaps less redundant, but things like that.

00:02:37 SPK_1
Beauty.

00:02:40 SPK_3
Then you can comment again.

00:02:45 SPK_3
Exactly.

00:02:45 SPK_3
Hey?

00:02:45 SPK_3
Sorry I didn't hear right.

00:02:47 SPK_1
Yes, you can comment on Sprint now as well.

00:02:50 SPK_3
Oh ok, let me open the trailer again here.

00:02:55 SPK_3
Okay, talking about what worked, right?

00:03:00 SPK_3
Well, about what worked, I see that something that I found very interesting, very cool was that we stop even more or less in the middle of the week so we can see where the bugs were, you know?

00:03:12 SPK_3
Where the bugs were, being able to prepare, we focus on them to continue with other demands, right?

00:03:20 SPK_3
It was something I found very cool.

00:03:22 SPK_3
Super CDT.

00:03:31 SPK_4
Because I don't think so.

00:03:32 SPK_3
Saved another good here, it is about the necessary changes is ...

00:03:46 SPK_3
Okay, about the necessary changes, I believe that more than the CDD has greatly facilitated the visualization I think it's a little, like, it is to comment a little, in fact, is to comment more the colors, in general.

00:04:10 SPK_3
For example, yesterday, I had a little difficulty, that I was even with Junior there, with One up front, which I was seeing, we have a little difficulty understanding a specific screen, so to understand how to understand It worked.

00:04:27 SPK_3
Then I think with comments also makes it easier for someone else, I'm not just talking about me exclusively, but in general.

00:04:35 SPK_3
The action item I didn't fill anything.

00:04:59 SPK_1
No listener does not have no listener either.

00:05:00 SPK_3
And in this case CTDD was what I had said.

00:05:04 SPK_1
Ah, beauty.

00:05:06 SPK_3
I found this week like that, I found his dynamics very interesting, I felt.

00:05:14 SPK_1
Ah, beauty, that's right.

00:05:18 SPK_1
Does anyone more want to continue?

00:05:23 SPK_1
Could it be.

00:05:28 SPK_1
What worked in this sprint is basically the same answer as last week, what changes is Github with the Branches.

00:05:37 SPK_1
Last week, as I was working in pairs with Dion√≠sio and Carlos, then I had to check the fork of each one to get the codes updates.

00:05:49 SPK_1
Icloud Branch no, that Github, even though he doing Merge, right, when we do Git Pull, he's not disturbing my development.

00:05:59 SPK_1
Well, in the necessary changes ...

00:06:05 SPK_1
The retrospectives are on Saturday, I liked it today.

00:06:09 SPK_1
I prefer than on Friday.

00:06:11 SPK_3
Beauty.

00:06:13 SPK_1
The action items is to hit the project layout with the front end Devs.

00:06:19 SPK_1
Like, I put it because, for example, Lohan today she was adding more diagrams of how it will be, to get a better view of the application itself, so I took the opportunity to be able to develop and put the front end at the interface that was primarily primitive.

00:06:45 SPK_1
But so, there are some things that the Back-end people developed, Dionysus, Lucas, Lucas not, Carlos, Pedro, Daniel, who are some more things that were not at her interface, so I think I think You must have such a conversation to try to leave what you need to leave and remove whatever you need.

00:07:09 SPK_1
For example, there was also a functionality that I had put last week that I removed because it makes no sense, based on what it was putting there in Miro.

00:07:19 SPK_1
The questions and discussions are the minimum viable product of what we will discuss on Plane, and on the CDD I have a consideration of, so, as I am just making the accounting of the CP points at the end of my development, it is not impacting During development, only at the end.

00:07:44 SPK_1
I think comments in the code have been more effective than the CDD, in my opinion.

00:07:54 SPK_1
What is it contributing to me is just kind to understand what limit I have to have during my development.

00:08:01 SPK_1
For example, I was having a screen there, I think it was registration.

00:08:05 SPK_1
I was having a lot of basic widgets, so I was kind of just waking up, waking up and at the end I extrapolated my limit, which was 32 sources.

00:08:18 SPK_1
Other than that, he helps me to have this control, this brake, right?

00:08:21 SPK_1
Because, especially, I'm working more on the front.

00:08:27 SPK_1
And I have the suggestion that widget Buds costs to be removed from the table.

00:08:32 SPK_1
Because they are so understandable, even for those who are just doing the backhand.

00:08:47 SPK_1
Beauty, thanks.

00:08:48 SPK_1
Anyone who is coming back?

00:08:50 SPK_1
Daniel or Pedro?

00:08:52 SPK_3
Are you listening to me?

00:09:05 SPK_5
So I can start here.

00:09:08 SPK_5
In what worked, let me see here.

00:09:11 SPK_5
The people found the bugs, right?

00:09:15 SPK_5
Is anyone talking?

00:09:19 SPK_5
Okay, are you listening to me there or not?

00:09:20 SPK_1
Wow, I'm listening, I think your Discord bugged again, Waze.

00:09:23 SPK_1
Ah, it was bad, I'm going out here and getting in again.

00:09:26 SPK_1
Beauty.

00:09:28 SPK_5
Okay, beauty.

00:09:30 SPK_5
Is it the waze that is listening to me there?

00:09:31 SPK_1
Aham, now I'm.

00:09:32 SPK_1
I don't know why there is this bug, but ...

00:09:36 SPK_5
Okay.

00:09:36 SPK_5
Then what worked, the people were discovering the bugs, right, then I ...

00:09:40 SPK_5
What worked for me was to fix these bugs, the assigned tasks.

00:09:46 SPK_5
Although I got the mistake of having caught a lot of tasks, I thought it wasn't going to work, but it turned out to be all right.

00:09:56 SPK_5
And also the part of working with prints.

00:10:00 SPK_5
I think this new format helped a lot.

00:10:03 SPK_5
Because before I had, for example, to go there at Carlos's fork and see what he had done.

00:10:11 SPK_5
Necessary changes, I didn't put anything.

00:10:17 SPK_5
Action items, we need to better organize the code, that format that Ron sent in the group.

00:10:26 SPK_5
It's a part that I have to start implementing this in my code.

00:10:34 SPK_5
Let me see, a question of discussions.

00:10:39 SPK_5
It's just about ...

00:10:41 SPK_5
We discuss the delivery of the viable minimum project, whether it will continue to be the same or if there will be something new.

00:10:50 SPK_5
In my opinion I think you have to be careful if we are putting a lot of new things because otherwise we will have to put it all over again and may end up not giving time to deliver.

00:11:06 SPK_5
And about the CD ...

00:11:10 SPK_5
I'm enjoying using it, let me see what was my answer.

00:11:19 SPK_5
So far, no class of mine has reached the most, but I'm not right if you have to increase or decrease, because I don't know if in the future the code can get more complex, you know?

00:11:32 SPK_5
So I'm not very right yet.

00:11:35 SPK_5
And about the CDD, I think the basic, lap -like branches, I think they should be removed and should not be accounted for by the ICB.

00:11:46 SPK_5
For now that's it.

00:11:51 SPK_1
Just the ...

00:11:52 SPK_4
What worked on Sprint.

00:12:03 SPK_4
I put here to separate the tasks better.

00:12:08 SPK_4
Because in the first sprint, I think ...

00:12:11 SPK_4
Like, Carlos and Daniel took a lot of task, then it was ...

00:12:14 SPK_4
It was hard to know what was going on.

00:12:18 SPK_4
Then now there was a better distributed form, then it became easier to organize.

00:12:28 SPK_4
Also, right, we had that document that Ron prepared with the requirements and such the project, how it should work.

00:12:39 SPK_4
We had a better view of the product itself, right, and how it works globally.

00:12:48 SPK_4
And the change in the workflow, in Github, to use Branch in relation to the way it was before, right, that each one was separate, there was bad to see where the changes in the code was now centered, then it's easier to see any more recent change.

00:13:09 SPK_4
Necessary changes.

00:13:13 SPK_4
I put what I said before during a meeting, that standardize the name of the widget classes to be as far as possible have the same name as the file where it is.

00:13:27 SPK_4
For when we are reference, we find it easier.

00:13:38 SPK_3
Guys, sorry, just remembering that I need to go out here, okay?

00:13:40 SPK_2
I don't have ...

00:13:40 SPK_1
Beauty.

00:13:40 SPK_3

of...

00:13:55 SPK_3
of.

00:13:58 SPK_4
In the action items.

00:14:01 SPK_4
I just wrote down here to be registered, which is that part of putting the names of the files in the pattern of Snake Case and such, the names of the classes and everything.

00:14:17 SPK_4
In the discussion I didn't put anything and on the CDD I got a task to make the development it was.

00:14:27 SPK_1
Of.

00:14:29 SPK_4
Start the project, only I talking to Ron after I saw that I couldn't do it, right?

00:14:36 SPK_4
Because it depended on features that have not yet been implemented, which are in the backlog.

00:14:42 SPK_4
Because I didn't touch this part of the execution, you did that test part.

00:14:48 SPK_4
But while I was trying to do it, I think it helped me understand the code that is already made, right?

00:14:56 SPK_4
For...

00:14:58 SPK_4
Try to follow from that, looking at Carlos and Daniel's code, for example.

00:15:02 SPK_1
I just wanted to give a consideration about the CDD, for example, the boys there commented on the reduction of points, right?

00:15:14 SPK_1
So I don't agree that you should decrease, because, for example, the people who work on the back-end were seeing the classes there before taking it to turn to the front end, for example, the numbers were very low, which It could reach 32 nor if new back-end features were implemented.

00:15:34 SPK_1
Then, for example, 8, 12, 14 ...

00:15:35 SPK_1
Only then, when I was developing the front end, they increased.

00:15:41 SPK_1
And, for example, there was a class there that she had a lot of back-end focused and also had many components.

00:15:49 SPK_1
And, like, it made no sense to make the front end and component, and that class already had many components.

00:15:57 SPK_1
Then it was over ...

00:15:59 SPK_1
This is my consideration.

00:16:01 SPK_5
Nor for me either.

00:16:03 SPK_4
I accept.

00:16:05 SPK_1
So, repeat please, Carlos, about ...

00:16:07 SPK_4
Just the CDD and then I go.

00:16:09 SPK_1
Follow in the home, which is recorded.
