00:00:02 SPK_1
Okay, beauty.

00:00:03 SPK_1
So if no one will have one more point, I have only the question here of ICP to talk, for us to make this definition.

00:00:12 SPK_1
If, I mean, there were some points, right, who raised there the last time.

00:00:18 SPK_1
But, looking at this table here, we, what we ...

00:00:23 SPK_1
First, do we need to change anything?

00:00:26 SPK_1
If so, what do we have to change here in this table?

00:00:28 SPK_1
What makes sense?

00:00:29 SPK_1
What no longer makes sense here?

00:00:32 SPK_1
Does anyone want to start?

00:00:35 SPK_2
I think it no longer makes sense of Riddick of basics.

00:00:42 SPK_1
Here, right?

00:00:44 SPK_3
What do you think there?

00:00:49 SPK_4
I think so too.

00:00:52 SPK_1
Okay, then ...

00:00:55 SPK_1
Pedro, why does not make sense?

00:01:04 SPK_3
I think it's not having any ...

00:01:06 SPK_3
The use or not of it, of this trigger, is having no impact on reading the code, for, for example, to add a complexity in it.

00:01:17 SPK_1
Then, when I add a column, it does not make it difficult to readability, it does not make it difficult to complex the code.

00:01:27 SPK_1
And that?

00:01:30 SPK_3
This does not make my understanding difficult for him.

00:01:38 SPK_1
Beauty, but does anyone have a point about it?

00:01:40 SPK_1
Does anyone disagree?

00:01:42 SPK_5
It's the same thing as Carlos as well.

00:01:44 SPK_2
I also agree with that.

00:01:48 SPK_1
Okay, beauty.

00:01:49 SPK_1
Ok, so we can make this change.

00:01:51 SPK_1
We can make this change here, remove the column.

00:01:56 SPK_1
So, I'll even do an analysis of how to manage this in the code, because there are several ECPs already ...

00:02:07 SPK_1
Remembering that we have to make a good discussion, even for next week the possibility of taking an ECP or changing it, like, does not happen ...

00:02:19 SPK_1
I mean, we are free, very free to do this, okay?

00:02:23 SPK_1
It is better that we make changes when necessary, okay?

00:02:28 SPK_1
But it would be nice to analyze things well so that no changes are made or very radical or constant.

00:02:38 SPK_1
Why?

00:02:38 SPK_1
Because now, beauty, let's take a column, let's take row, wrap ...

00:02:42 SPK_1
But we now have to update in the code, because we are commenting, it's not just.

00:02:47 SPK_1
There is no plugin to do this, for example.

00:02:51 SPK_1
There is the tip there for those who want a necessary research.

00:02:55 SPK_2
I can even take responsibility and analyze the whole system we are making and remove these comments.

00:03:03 SPK_1
Beauty, so you have to take the ICP comment and have to update the total cognitive load of the class.

00:03:11 SPK_1
Because you imagine you have several columns there, so there will be several ICPs.

00:03:16 SPK_1
Beauty?

00:03:19 SPK_1
Is there any other here?

00:03:21 SPK_1
I mean, in fact, let me ask more directly.

00:03:24 SPK_1
This one from If, Else, For, While, external, are they making sense?

00:03:33 SPK_1
For any else, for any if, for whatever I see, I will have an ICP there.

00:03:40 SPK_1
Or not, I just want when it has to do with the widget, if we control the widget.

00:03:45 SPK_1
Or not, it makes no sense anymore.

00:03:47 SPK_1
What are you thinking of this?

00:03:51 SPK_5
I think you have to keep it.

00:03:57 SPK_1
Everyone thinks?

00:03:58 SPK_2
Me too.

00:03:59 SPK_2
Aham.

00:04:03 SPK_1
Okay, why have Daniel have to keep up?

00:04:07 SPK_5
Because, at least in my code, I use a lot of If-Else in a way that you can't disregard.

00:04:13 SPK_1
I understood.

00:04:15 SPK_1
You use, for example, to work with service, with, I don't know ...

00:04:21 SPK_5
It is, for example, in the demand creation form, as is the same form, I needed to create some logics for ...

00:04:31 SPK_5
For example, right, because you can create or edit.

00:04:34 SPK_5
So when he clicks the button, he has to see the ...

00:04:37 SPK_5
What is the user doing to do the right thing too, understand?

00:04:41 SPK_5
Like this, sometimes the user can put a blank screen and such, so I put some ...

00:04:47 SPK_5
I put some IFs and Elses that detect this.

00:04:51 SPK_1
Okay, ok, I got it.

00:04:55 SPK_1
Beauty, does anyone have something else to add about it?

00:05:00 SPK_2
The very part of readability for those who are not developing, for example, like Daniel, right?

00:05:05 SPK_2
Then sometimes I take the screens he makes.

00:05:08 SPK_2
Then, for example, there was one there that he used a lot if IF-Else.

00:05:12 SPK_2
There, just from ...

00:05:14 SPK_2
and...

00:05:15 SPK_2
Ok the comment, right?

00:05:16 SPK_2
That, Oh, this is a .cp, that I know, right?

00:05:19 SPK_2
Which is if-S, each costs one.

00:05:21 SPK_2
And it makes sense each cost one, because sometimes he uses if-alse for different things, not just for the form, to update the screen as well.

00:05:29 SPK_2
So, like, it's important to have this CP yet.

00:05:31 SPK_1
Beauty, ok.

00:05:33 SPK_1
So you keep the understanding last time, right?

00:05:41 SPK_1
Okay, come on.

00:05:42 SPK_1
Another thing that you may not have ...

00:05:44 SPK_1
That is, some people have not yet understood very well about the coupling.

00:05:52 SPK_1
For example, I saw that some people have put coupling for One-Preced.

00:05:59 SPK_1
And maybe it's confusing a little ...

00:06:01 SPK_1
That is, this is it, the function as an argument.

00:06:04 SPK_1
It is confusing a little what is a function as an argument.

00:06:07 SPK_1
A function as an argument A function as an argument is when a class receives as a parameter of this class a function.

00:06:22 SPK_1
For example, I used that button example, but it could be any other type of class.

00:06:30 SPK_1
And then perhaps because of the example I gave, some people thought onpressed was a function coupling.

00:06:36 SPK_1
OnPressed is not a function coupling.

00:06:38 SPK_1
Why?

00:06:39 SPK_1
Because, let's suppose, you have a textbutton, a materialbutton, an elevatedbutton, it is a class, it is a flutter widget and it has this onpressed parameter so it is not a class that you are creating and you are receiving a function As an argument so onpressed is not a function as an argument so it does not tell the ICP will only count when I create this class and this class I created it receives a function and then I put it, even, I don't even put it where I call the function where I actually pass the function.

00:07:18 SPK_1
I put there where, within the class I created, above the variable, I don't know, let's assume that I created the variable, the name is, I don't know, it's function, I don't think you can see another.

00:07:36 SPK_1
Yeah, I don't know, myfunction.

00:07:38 SPK_1
And then this myfunction, her type is a function.

00:07:40 SPK_1
It can be a void callback, which is a type of function.

00:07:48 SPK_1
And then I put this CP up there.

00:07:50 SPK_1
Can you understand this here that I'm talking about?

00:08:02 SPK_1
So that's it.

00:08:04 SPK_1
Just be aware that function as an argument first, I only count on the class that I created the functions, and it is a function received as an argument, and I will comment on this variable that I created.

00:08:23 SPK_1
And then, depending on this class, I think everyone understood.

00:08:27 SPK_1
I think I didn't see errors to count it.

00:08:34 SPK_1
Then the question still makes sense the C2 of CP?

00:08:44 SPK_1
Beauty.

00:08:58 SPK_1
Anything else you want to highlight, want to talk more about?

00:09:03 SPK_1
Asynchronous functions or asynchronous widgets, state management.

00:09:15 SPK_1
For example, these animated here.

00:09:20 SPK_1
Are you already working with them?

00:09:21 SPK_2
Not yet, because the design is not yet defined.

00:09:25 SPK_2
That's why I even want to talk to you and Alohane.

00:09:29 SPK_2
Because it is no use creating something and then having to be removed.

00:09:36 SPK_2
As was the case of a bar that I did.

00:09:40 SPK_2
For the form, only in the design of the canvas flow, it is not present and also makes no sense to have it.

00:09:48 SPK_2
Then I'm not using it yet.

00:09:50 SPK_2
I have a point for Flutter Block and Form Form Block, type, lower from 3 to 2.

00:09:58 SPK_2
I don't know if the others agree.

00:10:00 SPK_1
Ah, why download?

00:10:04 SPK_1
How to download and why?

00:10:07 SPK_2
I think he's less complex to read in the current sprint than before.

00:10:13 SPK_2
For example, before we had not so much practice.

00:10:17 SPK_2
And now with us developing the application, it has become less complex to understand.

00:10:28 SPK_1
I understood.

00:10:30 SPK_1
Does anyone agree?

00:10:30 SPK_1
Does anyone disagree?

00:10:31 SPK_1
How is it?

00:10:39 SPK_4
You can talk again, man, that my internet is cutting.

00:10:43 SPK_2
I was just saying that I have the suggestion of lowering Flutterblock and FlutterFormerBlock ICP for 2 instead of 3.

00:10:59 SPK_2
Because with us working on this project, his complexity rate lowered due to our own practice with him using.

00:11:09 SPK_2
He is less complex than before we started developing this application.

00:11:13 SPK_4
Oh yes, yes.

00:11:15 SPK_4
That is true.

00:11:15 SPK_1
Until.

00:11:18 SPK_4
Because we're using more too, right?

00:11:20 SPK_4
In various applications of him, during ...

00:11:26 SPK_4
throughout the application.

00:11:31 SPK_1
I understood.

00:11:31 SPK_1
So this 3 here is more related to the lack of practice, the lack of understanding you had about Provider.

00:11:44 SPK_1
So you think you now have to decrease, for example, to 1 in 1, right?

00:11:48 SPK_1
1 When does it notify or 1 for the entire construction?

00:11:52 SPK_1
What is your proposal?

00:11:57 SPK_2
My proposal would be 1 for the whole construction.

00:12:01 SPK_2
There would be 3.

00:12:07 SPK_1
No, calm down, I didn't understand.

00:12:09 SPK_1
Like, do you want this here to turn 1 and ICP turn 1?

00:12:13 SPK_1
Or that Change Notify and consumes you come 1?

00:12:17 SPK_2
Exactly, Change Notify and consumes it come 1.

00:12:20 SPK_1
Okay, so the total would be 2.

00:12:23 SPK_2
Exactly, and below it would also be 2.

00:12:25 SPK_1
This one, I understood.

00:12:29 SPK_1
Carlos and Daniel there are commenting a lot, what do you think?

00:12:43 SPK_3
I'm not having a problem with the way you are now.

00:12:46 SPK_3
I couldn't even continue.

00:12:50 SPK_1
Do you think 3 is a good value, for example, to provide?

00:12:56 SPK_1
Don't you think it's too much?

00:13:00 SPK_1
of the discord of John.

00:13:13 SPK_2
That question that was commented last week to lower the maximum cognitive load because the classes were no more than 20, for example, 24.

00:13:23 SPK_2
Never beat 32.

00:13:29 SPK_2
Then with that, like, it will decrease.

00:13:41 SPK_1
No, it is, calm.

00:13:42 SPK_1
Before that, let's first think about ICP.

00:13:44 SPK_1
Then we think of total.

00:13:48 SPK_1
First let's think here about the cognitive load, right?

00:13:54 SPK_1
The complexity, in fact, of each item.

00:13:58 SPK_1
Ah, I think this item, a consumer, it is not two, because I think it is not that complex, because now I have improved even my understanding, I think the team has improved the understanding, we have a lot of practice , yes, then we will decrease and in the end we think about the total cognitive load.

00:14:17 SPK_1
For now let's think only of the complexity of the items.

00:14:24 SPK_1
And then João Pedro is coming to say that we have to reduce this consume for one.

00:14:31 SPK_1
Because understanding is improving.

00:14:33 SPK_1
It's not being so complex to the team.

00:14:37 SPK_1
Carlos is saying that it is to maintain.

00:14:42 SPK_1
So, who takes third opinion?

00:14:51 SPK_5
So, particularly I don't know why ...

00:14:55 SPK_5
This week, in fact, I was still going to take time to study this provider, which has not yet entered my head.

00:15:03 SPK_5
I need to do this because my code is getting, in my opinion, is getting very complex.

00:15:09 SPK_5
And Provider helps to take this complexity.

00:15:12 SPK_5
So, I think I should keep it.

00:15:21 SPK_1
What we can take a strategy here to try to define if it is 2, if it is 1, is to make a comparison.

00:15:31 SPK_1
It is comparing with other elements that we are continuing their complexity.

00:15:39 SPK_1
So you have to look at the consumer and look at the table in general.

00:15:46 SPK_1
Because we are we are defining the complexity of each of these items.

00:15:51 SPK_1
So this item is more complex than this, it is harder to implement, it is easier to implement, it is harder to understand, the concept is harder, easier.

00:16:00 SPK_1
So we are comparing these elements.

00:16:06 SPK_1
So much so that, for example, if you have a change here, the next question I am going to ask is, have to change, then, these guys here?

00:16:14 SPK_1
Futrestream?

00:16:21 SPK_1
Because the concepts here are kind of similar.

00:16:25 SPK_1
Okay, okay, which is asynchronous promotion, which is state management.

00:16:29 SPK_1
But there is a proximity there, we are talking about ...

00:16:32 SPK_1
of...

00:16:33 SPK_1
You change the state and notify everyone, for example.

00:16:42 SPK_1
Could a streamambuilder and futurebuilder be go-consumers?

00:16:45 SPK_1
It's just for us to have a comparison parameter.

00:16:51 SPK_2
Yeah, exactly.

00:16:52 SPK_2
I gave the suggestion precisely because we are working more.

00:16:59 SPK_2
Then, for example, Flutter Block, we have worked with it a lot.

00:17:05 SPK_2
Especially Carlos, which he did, he used Flutter Block and Flutter Form Block.

00:17:13 SPK_2
Then, for example, if we compare with the others, we are having more practice with these two, right?

00:17:21 SPK_2
than, for example, an asynchronous function.

00:17:24 SPK_2
That is why the asynchronous function should still continue.

00:17:28 SPK_5
There...

00:17:30 SPK_2
This was just a suggestion I had given, got it?

00:17:35 SPK_1
Okay, I understood.

00:17:36 SPK_1
I think that...

00:17:38 SPK_1
Even Daniel and Carlos are seeing this part there a little.

00:17:42 SPK_1
You can talk, but I think you are working hard on asynchronous function.

00:17:46 SPK_1
That I think any call to the bank is an asynchronous function, for example.

00:17:55 SPK_1
It's not that?

00:18:03 SPK_1
For example, I don't hear there, through a stream, the firebase?

00:18:11 SPK_1
Yes.

00:18:13 SPK_4
This question that we will also make for requests, too, I believe it is good.

00:18:21 SPK_1
So it is.

00:18:35 SPK_1
Does anyone want to add to this discussion?

00:18:47 SPK_1
Again, the question?

00:18:48 SPK_2
Yeah, we could keep it there and continue with just with, like, remove the basic widget.

00:19:02 SPK_1
I understood.

00:19:04 SPK_1
AND...

00:19:10 SPK_1
Then...

00:19:13 SPK_1
We will keep this ...

00:19:17 SPK_1
Both consumer and maybe this issue of manipulating a stream, manipulating a filter, such as 2GCP, I think it's reasonable, or I think it has to decrease to 1 too, because our understanding is getting better.

00:19:36 SPK_1
Then...

00:19:37 SPK_1
Still solve it.

00:19:42 SPK_1
So, who else?

00:19:44 SPK_1
Who else finds what about it?

00:19:47 SPK_1
Maintain or decrease?

00:19:48 SPK_5
I think it could really just take this basic widget and the rest keep.

00:19:56 SPK_1
Okay, ok.

00:19:57 SPK_4
Yeah, I think that's right.

00:19:58 SPK_1
AND...

00:20:02 SPK_1
What about the total cognitive load?

00:20:06 SPK_1
We last did, some people talked a little about reducing the total cognitive load because it wasn't affecting it, it was a high value.

00:20:20 SPK_1
And then it made it not to forces much to have to refact the class and such.

00:20:25 SPK_1
But João Pedro came with the issue of layout.

00:20:31 SPK_1
When you add a layout, because usually delivery, for example, from Daniel, are features, there is no part of the layout.

00:20:41 SPK_1
So much code there is, in quotes, ignored.

00:20:46 SPK_1
part of layout.

00:20:48 SPK_1
And then when the user's interface part comes, then there will come several earthquakes there, maybe some more widgets, maybe between the issue of animation, and that will increase the class.

00:21:03 SPK_1
It will increase the ICP, sorry.

00:21:05 SPK_1
Yeah, it will increase the class by definition.

00:21:10 SPK_1
So, what else can we talk about it and define?

00:21:16 SPK_2
For example, last week was touched at a point, and I even got up, that they were saying that a class, for example, had a very low cognitive load, for example 8, then I raised the point, which when the layout is added, The design, then the load increases, to much more than 8, for example, I set the example there, had an 8 class, then after I implemented, it increased to 20.

00:21:45 SPK_2
But still, she doesn't burst.

00:21:49 SPK_2
I take care not to burst the maximum conductive load.

00:21:52 SPK_2
When we remove these basic widgets, it will lower to 30.

00:21:57 SPK_2
And I still think we'll have problems with that.

00:22:04 SPK_1
Okay, I understood.

00:22:05 SPK_1
Thus, the idea is not much we do to see how ...

00:22:11 SPK_1
Okay, we have to analyze the impacts of ICP change, total change of cognitive load.

00:22:17 SPK_1
But the purpose is to manage the complexity of the class.

00:22:22 SPK_1
For us to manage the complexity of the class, we look at the items, for this table, define a maximum value there.

00:22:32 SPK_1
And then, when we make this definition, then we'll look at our classes and try to understand if they are complex according to our definitions.

00:22:40 SPK_1
So try not to make changes thinking about, I don't know, how it will be inside my class.

00:22:48 SPK_1
Did you understand?

00:22:49 SPK_1
So what we should look at is items of complexity.

00:22:54 SPK_1
Does it make sense of these items?

00:22:55 SPK_1
He does.

00:22:57 SPK_1
Total calculation, data and items we defined.

00:23:01 SPK_1
We define here as double or may even decrease a little more.

00:23:06 SPK_1
Look at that.

00:23:07 SPK_1
And after this definition we look at our classes.

00:23:10 SPK_1
Because it is this table and this total ICP that will define whether a class is complex or not.

00:23:17 SPK_1
So don't look too much to the class to define.

00:23:20 SPK_1
Like, imagine the classes there, how to decrease, make an account.

00:23:24 SPK_1
I'm not saying you're doing exactly that.

00:23:26 SPK_1
I'm just talking to avoid doing this.

00:23:35 SPK_1
Okay, so here ...

00:23:40 SPK_1
This one will leave, right?

00:23:43 SPK_1
So here it will fall to 30.

00:23:45 SPK_1
Exactly.

00:23:45 SPK_1
30 CP points.

00:23:52 SPK_1
Everyone agree?

00:23:57 SPK_4
Yes.

00:23:59 SPK_1
Yes.

00:24:01 SPK_1
Beauty.

00:24:04 SPK_1
Well, does anyone have something to add?

00:24:06 SPK_1
A tip there on any practice?

00:24:10 SPK_4
Just confirming the ID basically with the VAMMEN, that's?

00:24:14 SPK_1
Yeah, this is going out here.

00:24:16 SPK_4
So, in this case, the changes would be to change the basic edit and the cognitive load stay at 33.

00:24:22 SPK_1
Yeah, because as it is double, we are defining here that ICP is double the total of ICP and an ICP is coming out of here.

00:24:30 SPK_1
So here comes out two.

00:24:32 SPK_1
Leaves 32 to 30.

00:24:33 SPK_1

00:24:41 SPK_1
So, the interesting thing, I think I didn't even complete it at the beginning of the meeting, but the interesting thing is that you, I don't know if you are already doing it, right?

00:24:50 SPK_1

00:24:54 SPK_1
And then, when you are developing, I know you have some practices about first codar, then count ICP, right?

00:25:03 SPK_1
So when you count the ICP count, put the table on the side.

00:25:07 SPK_1
