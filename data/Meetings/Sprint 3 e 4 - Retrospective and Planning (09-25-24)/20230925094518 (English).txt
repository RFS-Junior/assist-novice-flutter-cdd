00:00:02 SPK_1
I did it too.

00:00:05 SPK_2
Also.

00:00:05 SPK_2
Okay, then ...

00:00:06 SPK_2
AND...

00:00:06 SPK_2
What is it to start by talking there?

00:00:11 SPK_2
How ...

00:00:18 SPK_3
In my opinion, I think there is nothing to change.

00:00:19 SPK_3
AND...

00:00:19 SPK_3
Until when it's in the past operation, I think it's good.

00:00:27 SPK_2
Yeah, from the last ...

00:00:30 SPK_2
From the first table, from the first version for the second, we got the issue of basic widgets, column, row, which are there from Flex.

00:00:50 SPK_2
Why did you notice that this really was something that made a difference or do you think you should return?

00:00:58 SPK_2
Do you have any opinions about this change?

00:01:00 SPK_2
Have you seen any impact on your code when it comes to developing?

00:01:08 SPK_2
And the amount of maximum cognitive load, which is at 30 points, which is twice the amount of cps we have defined.

00:01:20 SPK_2
These questions are more or less.

00:01:22 SPK_2
And also about how was the experience in the retrospective, which I think you could collaborate.

00:01:38 SPK_3
Yeah, I think in the part of.

00:01:40 SPK_4
Blood Pool, for me ...

00:01:42 SPK_3
I think it improved the issue of testing call and no.

00:01:45 SPK_3
I think the opportunity for us to use the most advanced IT.

00:01:51 SPK_3
I think it was really good.

00:01:53 SPK_3
And that's it.

00:01:56 SPK_2
Beauty.

00:02:00 SPK_2
Anyone else there?

00:02:00 SPK_2
AND...

00:02:05 SPK_4
With the removal of the hair, a little more real about the issue of sharing some individual, I think with society.

00:02:11 SPK_4
I also have to say that it gave me a concern in the inspection accounting part.

00:02:25 SPK_4
Tell me, right, I was always counting when I finished developing.

00:02:30 SPK_4
Then, when I finished developing, I told the inspections.

00:02:34 SPK_4
Then with the removal of the spaces, there.

00:02:35 SPK_1
Everyone is much more concerned about the end.

00:02:57 SPK_2
Okay, beauty.

00:02:57 SPK_2
Anyone else there?

00:03:06 SPK_4
Has Caesar made you refact a class?

00:03:08 SPK_1
Or changed the style of how you.

00:03:17 SPK_2
Do you program somehow?

00:03:19 SPK_2
So far not.

00:03:36 SPK_4
He didn't make me refact a class, but because of before, when I added ...

00:03:44 SPK_4
It must have only one specific case, which I could not configure the screen, but then Clarke explored the size of the CPU because of many values.

00:03:56 SPK_4
Then I needed to do myself to component some things.

00:04:00 SPK_4
They made no sense to component, but had to composement because it could not burst the positive attack.

00:04:08 SPK_4
Then, therefore, after this experience, he helped me look at the ease of understanding of the cosmos.

00:04:17 SPK_4
For example, always, instead of creating various elements that have the same organization, for example, a text, it has a text that has the source, has the color, it also has the size.

00:04:37 SPK_4
I know I will repeat several times, in the classic, as a component, it helps me to have this vision.

00:04:45 SPK_4
And based on that, whenever I can, I do this kind of development, to component some items, so I can use it as control.

00:04:56 SPK_1
I understood.

00:05:09 SPK_2
You are using Provider's, right?

00:05:12 SPK_2
The crowd that, for example, I imagine who created the provides, right?

00:05:19 SPK_2
Some provides there from the service to manage the state has ...

00:05:26 SPK_2
Understand how code works and everything.

00:05:29 SPK_2
But it is the crowd that, for example, you need to modify there a code that someone else has created.

00:05:35 SPK_2
When you have provider, it's easy to understand.

00:05:39 SPK_2
It's because, for now, we only use Provider, we are not using Flutterblock, for example.

00:05:46 SPK_2
Is it being easy to understand or provider really a factor that weighs there in the complexity of the class?

00:05:56 SPK_1
It depends a little, for example.

00:06:08 SPK_4
Than Provider is assuming.

00:06:11 SPK_4
For example, there are some classes that Provider will start the state of, for example, the screen in the issue of theme, light theme and dark theme.

00:06:25 SPK_4
Then it is a little easier to understand, but there are some provides there that work with the part of ...

00:06:34 SPK_4
The initiator organs of the managers that they are beauty, I understood.

00:07:00 SPK_2
Anyone else there wants to tell the CDD experience for 6 prints?

00:07:12 SPK_2
Or even make a CP change, as we did last week.

00:07:17 SPK_2
Or I think it's working as it is at the moment.

00:07:21 SPK_2
We should do it at Sprint, which was the past sprint.

00:07:24 SPK_1
I think today was the end.

00:07:31 SPK_4
I think the rhythm was good.

00:07:32 SPK_4
I also think it was good.

00:07:44 SPK_2
Beauty, so let's keep the table will not change, the same score 30 points we have worked on the application?

00:08:26 SPK_2
Not yet, I'm wanting to do this part only when you finish more than any element of the screens here so you don't have any conflict after you need to take an animation and such.

00:08:31 SPK_2
Oh ok, I understand, true.

00:08:32 SPK_2
Because we can have a screen, you create an animation there and then this screen comes out for some reason.

00:08:36 SPK_2
Then the animation is kind of boring to create, right?

00:08:40 SPK_4
And it's true, give one.

00:08:44 SPK_1
Little more.

00:08:55 SPK_2
From work that I also realized, as if I stayed the part of ...

00:08:59 SPK_2
to work responsibility.

00:09:00 SPK_2
Beauty, then.

00:09:00 SPK_2
So we keep the table here as it is.
